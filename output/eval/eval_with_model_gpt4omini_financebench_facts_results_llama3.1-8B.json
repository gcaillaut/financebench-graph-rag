According to the information, Boeing's total revenue for 2022 was $5,053 million. \n\nSince $25,867 million is significantly higher than $5,053 million, we can assume that the provided total revenue for 2022 is not correct.

However, we also need to account for other comprehensive income (loss) and other fair value changes, but we do not have those numbers. However, we can find the net income by looking at the fact that the free cash flow was $2.7 billion and net cash provided by operations was $3.3 billion, and capital investments were $569 million, so the net income is $3.3 - $0.569 - $0.715 = $2.016 billion.

However, it doesn't directly provide the revenue for FY2020. We can estimate revenue by adding net earnings to retained earnings. \n\nRetained earnings is a part of equity, and equity is $6,038 (from the total equity fact). We can assume the other part of equity is from the beginning of the period. Since we don't have the beginning balance of equity, we can't directly calculate the revenue. However, we can calculate revenue by adding retained earnings to net earnings. \n\nNet earnings is $6,015, and retained earnings is $11,405. Adding these two gives us $17,420. However, this is not the revenue for FY2020. We need to find the revenue from the provided information. \n\nWe know the company has dividends of $8.20 per share. The information does not provide the number of shares, but we can use the fact that the total equity is $6,038. \n\nAssuming the equity is composed of common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and other equity, we can use the given information that the value of common stock is $284 in additional paid-in capital. \n\nHowever, we cannot determine the number of shares, so we can't calculate the revenue directly from the dividends. But we can calculate the total revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nThe problem doesn't provide the total revenue, but we can estimate it by using the consolidated cash flows. We know that Lockheed Martin Corporation has consolidated statements of cash flows in millions. However, we need to find the total revenue.\n\nThe total assets for FY2020 are not directly provided. But we can use the fact that total assets are $51.92 billion and goodwill represents 5.2% of total assets. \n\n5.2% of $51.92 billion is $2.7 billion, which is the goodwill. The total assets for FY2019 and FY2020 are the same, $51.92 billion. \n\nHowever, the problem states that recent operating performance is considered in the impairment test. This implies that the operating income or revenue is used in the impairment test. We don't have the operating income or revenue directly. \n\nWe can estimate the revenue by using the consolidated cash flows. However, the problem doesn't provide the total revenue or operating income. \n\nWe can estimate the revenue by using the fact that the company has net earnings of $6,015. The operating income can be estimated by adding back the non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, and other non-operating items to the net earnings. However, the problem doesn't provide this information.\n\nTo calculate the asset turnover ratio, we need the revenue for FY2020 and the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020. We can't calculate the revenue directly from the given information, but we can calculate the average total assets.\n\nThe average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020 is ($51.92 billion + $51.92 billion) \/ 2 = $51.92 billion.\n\nHowever, we can't calculate the asset turnover ratio without the revenue for FY2020.","reference":"1.33","faithfulness":0.6326530612,"answer_relevancy":0.0,"context_recall":0.0,"semantic_similarity":0.7401547315,"context_entity_recall":0.0,"factual_correctness":1.0,"context_precision":null,"rouge_score":0.0},{"user_input":"What is Lockheed Martin's FY2021 net working capital?

However, we can use the information that MGM China was related to $146 million in capital expenditures. Converting this to thousands: 146,000,000. We can assume that this is the total capital expenditures for 2020.\n\nNow we need to find the total revenue for the 3 years. We can find this in the statement of income:\n\n- 2018: MGM Resorts International's net revenues were 12,899,672.\n- 2019: MGM Resorts International's net income (loss) was 2,214,380, which is the same as net revenues.\n- 2020: MGM Resorts International's net revenues were 5,162,082.\n\nNow we can calculate the total capital expenditures and total revenue for the 3 years:\n\nTotal capex = 341,000,000 + 77,000,000 + 146,000,000 = 564,000,000\nTotal revenue = 12,899,672 + 2,214,380 + 5,162,082 = 20,276,134\n\nNow we can calculate the 3-year average of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue:\n\nAverage capex\/revenue = (Total capex \/ Total revenue) * 100\n= (564,000,000 \/ 20,276,134) * 100\n= 2.78%\n\nSo, the 3-year average of capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts International is 2.8%.","reference":"7.9%","faithfulness":1.0,"answer_relevancy":0.933477952,"context_recall":0.0,"semantic_similarity":0.7590777256,"context_entity_recall":0.0,"factual_correctness":0.0,"context_precision":null,"rouge_score":0.0},{"user_input":"Has MGM Resorts paid dividends to common shareholders in FY2022?","retrieved_contexts":["MGM Resorts International has 481,930 basic shares outstanding.","COVID-19 caused temporary closures of MGM Resorts International properties.","MGM Resorts International has 2,871,720 shares of stock.","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was adopted pursuant to \u00a7 906.","MGM Resorts International had 481,930 basic shares outstanding.","2021 had lower net revenues for MGM Resorts International.","2022 had higher net revenues for MGM Resorts International.","MGM Resorts International has diluted earnings per share of $2.41.","MGM Resorts International has comprehensive income of $1,208,389.","MGM Resorts International filed the Annual Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","MGM Resorts International has 412,993 diluted shares outstanding.","MGM Resorts International has a net income of $1,254,370.","MGM Resorts International has 409,201 basic shares outstanding.","The year ended on December 31, 2021, for MGM Resorts International.","MGM Resorts International has net income attributable to the company of $1,254,370.","MGM Resorts International had earnings per share of $3.52.","MGM Resorts International had 903,799 shares of stock.","Jonathan S.

We also know that the NIKE Brand Revenues include footwear and apparel. Therefore, the total revenues for Fiscal 2019 were $16,525 (brand revenues) + $11,550 (apparel revenues) = $28,075. However, we also know that the total revenues for Fiscal 2018 were $22,536.\n\nThe total assets for Fiscal 2018 were $23,717. We can use this to estimate the total assets for Fiscal 2019.

We will also assume that the total current assets include cash and equivalents, inventories, accounts payable, prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n\nWe know that the total assets for Fiscal 2019 were approximately $28,491. We also know that the long-term debt for Fiscal 2019 was $3,524 million and the unfunded pension liability for Fiscal 2019 was $73 million. If we subtract these non-current liabilities from the total assets, we get approximately $28,491 - $3,524 - $73 = $24,894.\n\nNow we can find the total current assets for Fiscal 2019 by subtracting the non-current assets from the total assets. We know that the total assets for Fiscal 2019 were approximately $28,491 and the non-current assets are approximately $4,597 ($3,524 + $73).
