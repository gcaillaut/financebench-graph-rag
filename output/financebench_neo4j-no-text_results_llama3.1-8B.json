        "expected": "Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: \n-Decrease in gross Margin\n-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges",
        "predicted": "To determine the operating margin change for 3M as of FY2022, we need to look at the provided passages for any information related to operating income or operating expenses.\n\nHowever, the provided passages do not contain explicit information on operating income or operating expenses for FY2022. They do contain various metrics such as EBITDAR contribution, sales growth, and cash flow from operating activities, but not the specific operating margin.\n\nOperating margin is a useful metric for companies as it indicates the profitability of a company's core business operations. However, for a company like 3M, which has a complex business structure and engages in various activities such as acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring, operating margin might not be the most useful metric.\n\n3M has a large number of subsidiaries and business segments, and the company's financial performance can be influenced by various factors such as goodwill impairment, restructuring costs, and litigation expenses. These factors can make it challenging to accurately calculate and interpret the operating margin.\n\nFurthermore, 3M's business model is diversified across various industries, including healthcare, consumer, and industrial, and the company's operating performance can be influenced by factors specific to each industry. Therefore, operating margin might not provide a complete picture of the company's overall financial performance.\n\nIn this case, it would be more useful to look at other metrics such as EBITDAR contribution, which provides a more comprehensive view of the company's profitability, or cash flow from operating activities, which indicates the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations.",

However, based on the data provided, we can see that several segments have had significant issues and costs associated with them.\n\nThe segment that has been mentioned multiple times as having issues is the \"Safety and Industrial\" segment, particularly related to the production of PFAS substances and the associated costs of remediation, litigation, and compliance.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Health Care\" segment has also had issues, including lawsuits and settlements related to the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities.\n\nIt's worth noting that the passages do not provide a clear answer to your question, and it's difficult to determine which segment has \"dragged down\" 3M's overall growth.

        "expected": "Yes. Boeing has product and service categories that represent more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022. These categories are Commercial Airplanes which comprises 39% of total revenue, Defence which comprises 35% of total revenue and Services which comprises 26% of total revenue.",
        "predicted": "From the given knowledge graph, we can see that Boeing's total revenue is $10,550. However, we cannot determine the exact revenue of each product or service category. \n\nHowever, we can see that Boeing has several product categories and service categories, such as Defense, Space & Security, Commercial Airplanes, Global Services, and Boeing Capital, which are mentioned as EBITDAR contributions. But the exact revenue of each category is not provided.\n\nWe can infer that Defense, Space & Security and Commercial Airplanes are likely significant contributors to Boeing's revenue, but we cannot determine the exact percentage without more information.",

        "question": "Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",
        "expected": "Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.",
        "predicted": "The provided passages do not contain information about Boeing's gross margin profile. Gross margin is a useful metric for companies that primarily generate revenue from sales of products or services. However, Boeing is a diversified company with a mix of product sales, services, and defense contracts, which makes gross margin a less useful metric for this company.\n\nA more relevant metric for Boeing might be EBITDAR (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent) contribution, which is mentioned in the passages.",
        "justification": "Gross margin%=Gross margin/Total revenues*100=3,502/66,608*100=5.3% for 2022 and 3,017/62,286*100=4.8% for 2021.",

        "expected": "Yes. Corning had a positive working capital amount of $831 million by FY 2022 close. This answer considers only operating current assets and current liabilities that were clearly shown in the balance sheet.",
        "predicted": "The provided text passages do not include any information about working capital. The passages mention cash flow, total assets, and capital expenditure, but not working capital directly.\n\nHowever, we can infer that working capital might not be a useful or relevant metric for this company because the passages focus on financial statements and agreements that are more related to long-term financial health and strategic decisions rather than short-term liquidity and working capital management.\n\nIf we were to infer working capital from the available data, we would need to calculate it using the provided data, which is not possible here. But based on the information provided, it seems that the company's financial focus is more on long-term goals and strategic decisions rather than short-term liquidity.\n\nHowever, based on the data available, we can calculate cash flow, which is a component of working capital. \n\nWe can see that Corning Incorporated has a HAS_CASH_FLOW attribute in all passages, but we cannot determine if it is positive or negative.",

        "question": "If JPM went bankrupted by the end by 2021 Q1 and liquidated all of its assets to pay its shareholders, how much could each shareholder get?",
        "expected": "They could receive $66.56 per share.",
        "predicted": "To determine how much each shareholder could get if JPMorgan Chase went bankrupt and liquidated all its assets, we need to find the total value of its assets.\n\nFrom the passages, there are multiple mentions of the total assets, but only two specific values are mentioned:\n\n- $20.9 billion\n- $25.7 billion\n\nSince there are multiple mentions of these values, it's likely that these are the correct values. However, we cannot be certain without further information.\n\nAssuming the higher value is correct, if JPMorgan Chase had $25.7 billion in total assets and went bankrupt, the assets would be divided among the shareholders. However, this is a complex process, and the actual payout would depend on the number of shares outstanding, the type of shares, and other factors.\n\nTo give a rough estimate, let's assume there are approximately 10.8 billion shares outstanding (based on historical data). If the bank's assets were liquidated and distributed evenly among the shareholders, each shareholder would receive:\n\n$25.7 billion ÷ 10.8 billion shares ≈ $2.38 per share\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified calculation and actual payouts would likely be more complex and involve various factors such as:\n\n- Debt obligations and liabilities\n- Priority of claims\n- Asset valuation and liquidation costs\n- Shareholder classes and voting rights\n\nThis is a rough estimate and should not be taken as investment advice.",

        "question": "What is the FY2018 - FY2020 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for MGM Resorts? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.",
        "expected": "7.9%",
        "predicted": "To calculate the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts, we need to identify the relevant information from the statement of cash flows and the statement of income.\n\nFrom the statement of cash flows, we can see that MGM Resorts' capital expenditures (capex) are as follows:\n\n- FY2018: $1.4 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $1.4 billion)\n- FY2019: $1.1 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $1.1 billion)\n- FY2020: $1.2 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $1.2 billion)\n\nFrom the statement of income, we can see that MGM Resorts' revenue is as follows:\n\n- FY2018: $12.82 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $12.82 billion)\n- FY2019: $13.7 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $13.7 billion)\n- FY2020: $8.78 billion (MGM Resorts International, HAS_CASH_FLOW, $8.78 billion)\n\nNow, let's calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year:\n\n- FY2018: ($1.4 billion / $12.82 billion) * 100% ≈ 10.9%\n- FY2019: ($1.1 billion / $13.7 billion) * 100% ≈ 8.0%\n- FY2020: ($1.2 billion / $8.78 billion) * 100% ≈ 13.7%\n\nTo calculate the 3-year average, we can take the average of these percentages:\n\n(10.9 + 8.0 + 13.7) / 3 ≈ 10.9%\n\nSo, the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts is approximately 10.9%.",

The various simpler metrics (from the current and, if relevant, previous fiscal year(s)) used were:\n\nMetric 1: Capital expenditures.

However, I can guide you through the process and identify the missing information.\n\nTo calculate EBITDA, we need the operating income from the income statement and the depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement.\n\nThe income statement is not provided, but we can look at the cash flow statement to find the depreciation and amortization.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we can see that there is a line item for \"Depreciation and amortization\" in the operating activities section, but the exact value is not provided.\n\nHowever, we can see that there is a line item for \"Net income\" in the net income section, which might be used to back-calculate the operating income from the income statement.\n\nAssuming that the provided information is from the statement of cash flows and income statement for FY2022, we can look at the net income and then work backwards to estimate the operating income and then EBITDA.\n\nUnfortunately, the net income is not provided in the given text, but if we assume it to be a value, we can then use the provided information to estimate the operating income.\n\nFrom the provided text, we can see that there is a line item for \"Net income attributable to PepsiCo\" under HAS_NET_PROFIT_MARGIN. However, this is not the exact value we are looking for, but it is a good starting point.\n\nWe can also see that there is a line item for \"Net income\" under HAS_CASH_FLOW, which is not the exact value we are looking for, but it might be a good estimate.\n\nHowever, without the exact value of net income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures, we cannot accurately calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo.",

        "predicted": "To determine Verizon's liquidity profile, we need to calculate the current ratio or quick ratio. However, the given data does not include information on Verizon's current liabilities and current assets, which are required to calculate the current ratio or quick ratio.\n\nThe quick ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventory by the sum of current liabilities. However, without the exact values of current liabilities and current assets, we cannot accurately determine Verizon's quick ratio.\n\nIf we were to look at the cash flow data, we can see that Verizon has a significant amount of cash inflows and outflows. However, without more context, it is difficult to assess its liquidity profile based solely on the given data.\n\nIn general, a quick ratio of 1:1 or higher is considered a good indicator of liquidity. However, without the actual numbers, we cannot determine Verizon's quick ratio for FY 2022.\n\nTherefore, I would say that we cannot accurately determine Verizon's liquidity profile based on the provided data.",

        "expected": "Yes. Verizon's capital intensity ratio was approximately 2.774729. This means that it took approximately $2.77 of assets to generate $1 of revenue and thus, Verizon can be considered capital intensive.",
        "predicted": "Based on the data provided, Verizon has a significant amount of capital expenditures. The values for capital expenditures are:\n\n- $340 million\n- $310 million\n- $2,507\n\nThese values indicate that Verizon does invest heavily in capital expenditures, which is a characteristic of a capital-intensive business.",
