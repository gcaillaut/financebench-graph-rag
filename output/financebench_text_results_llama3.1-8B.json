            "The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit rating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. Moody’s Investor Service downgraded the Company’s credit rating from A1 to A2, and S&P Global Ratings downgraded the Company’s credit rating from A to A- (and downgraded the Company’s short-term credit rating from A-2 to A-1), in connection with the Company’s announcement of the Settlement. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.",

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. These adjustments consist of normal, recurring items. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by the requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of their voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. The Aearo Entities have appealed the court’s dismissal decision. See additional information in Note 14.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker—impacting 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment re-aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 15. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is a result of the dilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect of 36.9 million and 36.5 million average options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and 31.9 million and 27.5 million average options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. In periods of net losses, these antidilutive effects include all weighted option shares outstanding and weighted average shares is the same for the calculations of both basic and diluted loss per share. The computations for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share follow:\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share Computations\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) attributable to 3M\n$\n(6,841) $\n78 $\n(5,865) $\n1,377\nDenominator:\nDenominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding – basic\n553.9\n571.0\n553.3\n571.6\nDilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans Denominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding – diluted\n—\n553.9\n1.7\n572.7\n—\n553.3\n2.2\n573.8\nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders — basic\n$\n(12.35) $\n0.14 $\n(10.60) $\n2.41\nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders — diluted\n$\n(12.35) $\n0.14 $\n(10.60) $\n2.40\n7\nTable of Contents\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were approximately $290 million and $260 million, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of applicable standards issued and not yet adopted by 3M.\nNOTE 2. Revenue\nContract Balances:\nDeferred revenue primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts. Deferred revenue (current portion) as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $521 million and $538 million, respectively. Approximately $150 million and $350 million of the December 31, 2022 balance was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, while approximately $140 million and $340 million of the December 31, 2021 balance was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.\nOperating Lease Revenue:\nNet sales includes rental revenue from durable medical devices as part of operating lease arrangements (reported within the Medical Solutions Division), which was $146 million and $285 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $148 million and $284 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.\n8\nTable of Contents\nDisaggregated revenue information:\nThe Company views the following disaggregated disclosures as useful to understanding the composition of revenue recognized during the respective reporting periods:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\nNet Sales (Millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\nAbrasives\n$\n334 $\n346 $\n675 $\nAutomotive Aftermarket\n305\n289\n617\nClosure and Masking Systems\n241\n270\n486\nElectrical Markets\n329\n336\n653\nIndustrial Adhesives and Tapes\n545\n586\n1,089\nPersonal Safety Roofing Granules\n878 133\n972 125\n1,781 243\nTotal Safety and Industrial Business Segment\n2,765\n2,924\n5,544\nAdvanced Materials\n305\n307\n606\nAutomotive and Aerospace Commercial Solutions\n477 455\n428 448\n939 887\nElectronics\n714\n863\n1,386\nTransportation Safety\n240\n222\n423\nTotal Transportation and Electronics Business Segment\n2,191\n2,268\n4,241\nFood Safety\n—\n89\n—\nHealth Information Systems\n302\n309\n602\nMedical Solutions\n1,161\n1,169\n2,284\nOral Care\n351\n350\n692\nSeparation and Purification Sciences\n247\n262\n479\nOther Health Care\n14\n—\n28\nTotal Health Care Business Group\n2,075\n2,179\n4,085\nConstruction and Home Improvement Markets\n542\n560\n1,071\nHome, Health and Auto Care\n428\n428\n828\nStationery and Office\n323\n342\n586\nTotal Consumer Business Group\n1,293\n1,330\n2,485\nCorporate and Unallocated\n1\n1\n1\nTotal Company\n$\n8,325 $\n8,702 $\n16,356 $\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\nNet Sales (Millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n4,678 $\n4,751 $\n9,077 $\nAsia Pacific\n2,134\n2,447\n4,314\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n1,513\n1,504\n2,965\nWorldwide\n$\n8,325 $\n8,702 $\n16,356 $\nAmericas included United States net sales to customers of $3.8 billion and $7.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $3.9 billion and $7.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.\n9\n2022\n675\n584\n528\n645\n1,207\n2,099 237\n5,975\n612\n888 902\n1,786\n420\n4,608\n181\n609\n2,297\n698\n522\n—\n4,307\n1,163\n865\n611\n2,639\n2\n17,531\n2022\n9,189\n5,217\n3,125\n17,531\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nRefer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on relevant pre-2023 acquisitions and divestitures.\nAcquisitions:\n3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses.\n2023 acquisitions:\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nDivestitures:\n3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders. As discussed in Note 15 (Business Segments), gains/losses on business divestitures are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n2023 divestitures and previously announced divestitures:\nIn May 2023, 3M entered into agreements to sell the assets associated with its dental local anesthetic business (part of the Health Care business) to Pierrel S.p.A. for $70 million in cash, subject to closing and other adjustments. The dental local anesthetic business has annual sales of approximately $30 million. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position of 19.9% in the business, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The spin-off transaction is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to customary conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, satisfactory completion of financing, and final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, among other items. 3M continues to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to required conditions, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, and developments involving 3M or any of its businesses, which could delay the completion of the transaction relative to the anticipated timeline. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\nOperating income and held-for-sale amounts:\nWith respect to the businesses above, operating income information of the Health Care business is included in Note 15. Further, with the respect to these businesses, there were no assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 and there were immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of June 30, 2023. Information related to other held for sale disposal groups is included in Note 13.\n10\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThere was no goodwill recorded from acquisitions during the first six months of 2023. The amounts in the “Translation and other” row in the following table primarily relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe goodwill balance by business segment follows:\n(Millions)\nSafety and Industrial\nTransportation and Electronics\nHealth Care\nConsumer\nTotal Company\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n4,509 $\n1,501 $\n6,515 $\n265 $\n12,790\nTranslation and other\n12\n9\n56\n2\n79\nBalance as of June 30, 2023\n$\n4,521 $\n1,510 $\n6,571 $\n267 $\n12,869\nAccounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as when events or conditions indicate that goodwill assigned to a reporting unit may be impaired. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. As described in Note 15, effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M changed its measure of segment operating performance and the composition of reportable segments and realigned divisions within the Consumer business segment. For any changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. The impacts of these changes on reported amounts were immaterial and resulted in no impairment. As of June 30, 2023, the Company's accumulated goodwill impairment loss is $0.3 billion.\nAcquired Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets, in addition to the balance of non-amortizable intangible assets follow:\n(Millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCustomer related intangible assets\n$\n4,084 $\n4,062\nPatents\n429\n426\nOther technology-based intangible assets\n2,089\n2,081\nDefinite-lived tradenames\n1,167\n1,166\nOther amortizable intangible assets\n82\n84\nTotal gross carrying amount\n7,851\n7,819\nAccumulated amortization — customer related\n(1,872)\n(1,747)\nAccumulated amortization — patents\n(426)\n(421)\nAccumulated amortization — other technology-based\n(1,098)\n(1,000)\nAccumulated amortization — definite-lived tradenames\n(543)\n(509)\nAccumulated amortization — other\n(59)\n(60)\nTotal accumulated amortization\n(3,998)\n(3,737)\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets — net\n3,853\n4,082\nNon-amortizable intangible assets (primarily tradenames)\n617\n617\nTotal intangible assets — net\n$\n4,470 $\n4,699\nCertain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 60 years, have a history of leading-market share positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an indefinite period of time.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAmortization expense follows:\nThree months ended June 30,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n(Millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nAmortization expense\n$\n121 $\n129 $\n243 $\n260\nExpected amortization expense for acquired amortizable intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2023 follows:\n(Millions)\nRemainder of 2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\nAfter 2028\nAmortization expense\n$\n236 $\n453 $\n423 $\n418 $\n398 $\n379 $\n1,546\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate. Actual amounts of amortization expense may differ from estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, impairment of intangible assets, accelerated amortization of intangible assets and other events. 3M expenses the costs incurred to renew or extend the term of intangible assets.\nNOTE 5. Restructuring Actions\n2023 to 2025 Structural Reorganization Actions\nIn the first quarter of 2023, 3M announced it would undertake structural reorganization actions to reduce the size of the corporate center of the Company, simplify supply chain, streamline 3M’s geographic footprint, reduce layers of management, further align business go-to-market models to customers, and reduce manufacturing roles to align with production volumes. During the first six months of 2023, management approved and committed to undertake associated actions impacting approximately 5,100 positions resulting in a pre-tax charge of $52 million and $212 million in the first and second quarters of 2023, respectively. Remaining activities related to the restructuring actions approved and committed under this initiative are expected to be largely completed through the end of 2023. 3M expects to commit to further actions under this initiative. This aggregate initiative beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and continuing through 2025 is expected to impact approximately 8,500 positions worldwide with an expected pre-tax charge of $700 million to $900 million over that period.\nThe related restructuring charges for periods presented were recorded in the income (loss) statement as follows:\n(Millions)\nThree months ended June 30, 2023\nSix months ended June 30, 2023\nCost of sales\n$\n47 $\n63\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n146\n178\nResearch, development and related expenses\n19\n23\nTotal operating income impact\n$\n212 $\n264\nThe business segment operating income (loss) impact of these restructuring charges is summarized as follows:\nThree months ended June 30, 2023\nSix months ended June 30, 2023\n(Millions)\nEmployee Related\nAsset-Related and Other\nTotal\nEmployee Related\nAsset-Related and Other\nTotal\nSafety and Industrial\n$\n44 $\n— $\n44 $\n54 $\n— $\n54\nTransportation and Electronics\n25\n—\n25\n37\n—\n37\nHealth Care\n10\n—\n10\n12\n—\n12\nConsumer\n13\n—\n13\n16\n—\n16\nCorporate and unallocated\n100\n20\n120\n125\n20\n145\nTotal operating expense\n$\n192 $\n20 $\n212 $\n244 $\n20 $\n264\n12\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring actions, including cash and non-cash impacts, follow:\n(Millions)\nEmployee-Related\nAsset-Related and Other\nTotal\nExpense incurred in the first quarter of 2023 Incremental expense incurred in the second quarter of 2023\n$\n52 $\n192\n— $\n20\nNon-cash changes\n—\n(20)\nCash payments\n(56)\n—\nAccrued restructuring action balance as of June 30, 2023\n$\n188 $\n— $\n2022 Restructuring Actions\nOperational/Marketing Capability Restructuring:\nAs described in Note 5 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in late 2020, 3M announced it would undertake certain actions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 to further enhance its operations and marketing capabilities to take advantage of certain global market trends while de-prioritizing investments in slower-growth end markets. In the first quarter of 2022, management approved and committed to undertake the remaining actions under this initiative resulting in a pre-tax charge of $18 million. This initiative, beginning in 2020 and ending with committed first quarter 2022 actions, impacted approximately 3,100 positions worldwide with a pre-tax charge of approximately $280 million over that period. Activities related to this restructuring were largely completed in the third quarter of 2022.\nDivestiture-Related Restructuring:\nAs described in Note 5 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the third quarter of 2022, following the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen completed in September 2022 (see Note 3 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K) management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated to the divested business.\nThese actions affected approximately 850 positions worldwide and resulted in a third quarter 2022 pre-tax charge of $41 million, within Corporate and Unallocated. The associated accrued restructuring balance as of December 31, 2022 was $10 million and remaining activities related to this divestiture-related restructuring were largely completed through the first half of 2023.\nNOTE 6.

Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 24.2 percent on a pre-tax loss, compared to (38.3) percent on pre-tax income in the prior year. The primary factor that impacted the comparison of these rates was the second quarter 2022 charge related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (see Note 14). The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was 25.2 percent, compared to 16.8 percent in the prior year. The primary factor that impacted the comparison of the six-month rates was the second quarter 2023 charge related to the proposed settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (discussed in Note 14).\nThe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are $989 million and $965 million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M’s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nAt June 30, 2023, 3M’s deferred tax assets, a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, also included a balance of approximately $2.4 billion as a result of the pre-tax charge related to the proposed settlement agreement announced in the second quarter of 2023 with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see Note 14). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had valuation allowances of $128 million and $115 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively.\nNOTE 9.

Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings\nIn February 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate registered notes that matured. In March 2023, 3M repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured. In May 2023, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n2022 issuances, maturities, and extinguishments of short- and long-term debt are described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company had $1.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2023, compared to no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nIn May 2023, 3M entered into a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028; the facility was amended in July 2023. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The agreement replaced the amended and restated $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement and the $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility that would have expired in November 2024 and November 2023, respectively. The credit facility was undrawn at June 30, 2023. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At June 30, 2023, this ratio, reflecting the July 2023 amendment, was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nFuture Maturities of Long-term Debt\nMaturities of long-term debt in the table below reflect the impact of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments and are net of the unamortized debt issue costs such that total maturities equal the carrying value of long-term debt as of June 30, 2023.

Derivatives\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K explains the types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, and how such instruments are accounted for. It also contains information regarding previously initiated contracts or instruments.\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n• •\nImpact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 7. Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 13. Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income (Loss) Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\nCash Flow Hedges:\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had a balance of $8 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $90 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2023, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of June 30, 2023, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $75 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following table.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on Derivative\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n$\n72 $\n128 $\n78 $\nInterest rate contracts\n—\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n72 $\n128 $\n78 $\nFair Value Hedges:\n3M had a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that was terminated in 2007 with respect to the Company's 30-year $220 million principal amount debenture due in 2028.

In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings.

However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOffsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements\nGross Amount of Derivative Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative Liabilities\nCash Collateral Received\nNet Amount of Derivative Assets\n(Millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n$\n155 $\n217 $\n46 $\n40 $\n— $\n— $\n109 $\n177\nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements\n—\n—\n—\n—\nTotal\n$\n155 $\n217\n$\n109 $\n177\nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements\nGross Amount of Derivative Liabilities Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative Assets\nCash Collateral Received\nNet Amount of Derivative Liabilities\n(Millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements\n$\n150 $\n142 $\n46 $\n40 $\n— $\n— $\n104 $\n102\nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements\n1\n—\n1\n—\nTotal\n$\n151 $\n142\n$\n105 $\n102\nCurrency Effects\n3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, increased pre-tax income (loss) by approximately $38 million and $74 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and increased pre-tax income (loss) by approximately $10 million and $27 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n25\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 13.

For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments, goodwill impairments, and adjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. There were no material impairments of assets or adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for the first six months of 2023 and 2022. As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the third quarter of 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of net assets in Russia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries and, as a result, recorded this held-for-sale disposal group at the lower of its fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount. In determining the carrying amount, the balance of cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be eliminated upon sale was included and a current liability of approximately $50 million was recorded largely representing a reserve against the balance of cumulative translation adjustment. In the second quarter of 2023, 3M closed on the sale of these subsidiaries, resulting in an immaterial gain after reversing this reserve while reclassifying the balance of cumulative translation adjustment into earnings.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-party’s internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(Millions)\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion\n$\n12,954 $\n11,471 $\n14,001 $\nThe fair values reflected in the sections above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of certain fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Company’s net investment in its European subsidiaries.\nNOTE 14. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings relate to matters including, but not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal healthcare program related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act and anti-kickback laws, securities, and environmental laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. The Company generally responds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil, or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the Company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.\n27\nFair Value\n12,484\nTable of Contents\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The categories of legal proceedings in which the Company is involved may include multiple lawsuits and claims, may be spread across multiple jurisdictions and courts which may handle the lawsuits and claims differently, may involve numerous and different types of plaintiffs, raising claims and legal theories based on specific allegations that may not apply to other matters, and may seek substantial compensatory and, in some cases, punitive, damages. These and other factors contribute to the complexity of these lawsuits and claims and make it difficult for the Company to predict outcomes and make reasonable estimates of any resulting losses. The Company's ability to predict outcomes and make reasonable estimates of potential losses is further influenced by the fact that a resolution of one or more matters within a category of legal proceedings may impact the resolution of other matters in that category in terms of timing, amount of liability, or both.\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in excess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company’s insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 4,066 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,028 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2022.\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen of the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In 2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above, and the appeal was dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M’s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of plaintiff’s mesothelioma. The plaintiff appealed the verdict. In May 2022, the First Division intermediate appellate court in Washington affirmed in part and reversed in part 3M’s trial victory, concluding that the trial court misapplied Washington law in instructing the jury about factual causation. The Washington Supreme Court declined to review the matter.\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. Since the second half of 2020, the Company has experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine dust; that increase represents a substantial majority of the growth in case numbers referred to above. The rate of coal mine dust-related case filings decelerated in 2022 and has continued to decelerate in 2023. 3M moved two cases involving over 400 plaintiffs to federal court based on, among others, the Class Action Fairness Act. The federal district court remanded the cases to state court. In March 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted 3M's petition to review the remand order, and in April 2023 reversed the district court's remand order; accordingly, those cases will remain in federal court.\n29\nTable of Contents\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the State’s motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3M’s respirators. In the first quarter of 2023, a bench trial for the unfair trade practices claims was continued indefinitely. An expert witness retained by the State has recently estimated that 3M sold over five million respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia as to key issues, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a factfinder may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses this analysis to develop its estimate of probable liability.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company’s accrual, including the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, and the average cost of defending and resolving claims and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co- defendants and insurers.\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in the first six months of 2023 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $33 million. In the first six months of 2023, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $49 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $588 million. This accrual represents the Company’s estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of (i) the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the fact that complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies\nOn April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. In July 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation (including the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters). This represented a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court had stayed the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters during the chapter 11 proceedings. With the June 2023 dismissal of the Aearo bankruptcy that is described in the Product Liability Litigation section below, the stay of respirator mask/asbestos litigation is no longer in effect. For additional information, see the discussion within the section Product Liability Litigation with respect to Aearo Technologies Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs.\nDuring the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings, 3M's accrual relating to the commitments associated with funding that trust included Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters. However, following the June 2023 dismissal of the Aearo bankruptcy, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $44 million as of June 30, 2023 for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\nThe Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, many for which private parties in the United States and abroad have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination. Please refer to the section entitled “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\")), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (\"PFOA\"), perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (\"PFHxS\"), perfluorobutane sulfonate (\"PFBS\"), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (\"HFPO-DA\") and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, \"PFAS\").\nAs a result of a phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to PFBS. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M’s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M’s decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.\nPFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues, including if regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M’s reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\n32\nTable of Contents\nEurope\nIn the European Union, where 3M has PFAS manufacturing facilities in countries such as Germany and Belgium, recent regulatory activities have included both preliminary and on-going work on various restrictions of PFAS or certain PFAS compounds under the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\") and the EU’s Persistent Organic Pollutants (\"POPs\") Regulation. PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS (and their related compounds) have also been listed in the Stockholm Convention, which has been ratified by more than 180 countries and aims for global elimination of certain listed substances (with narrow exceptions). In February 2023, an EU- wide restriction on the manufacturing, use, placing on the market and import of certain perfluorocarboxylic acids (C9-C14 PFCAs), which are PFAS substances, went into effect.\nIn February 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published the proposal it received in January 2023 from the national authorities of Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden to restrict PFAS under the European Union’s chemicals regulation. The proposal aims to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market and use of PFAS under REACH. In March 2023, the six-month consultation phase on the PFAS Restriction Proposal started. If the proposed rule becomes enforceable prior to 3M's announced exit from PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, depending on the scope and obligations contained in any final rule, PFAS manufacturers and manufacturers of PFAS containing products including 3M Belgium could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.\nEffective January 2023, the EU Food Contaminants Regulation targeting four PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (\"PFNA\"), and, PFHxS) in foodstuff (eggs and animal derived meat) prohibits the sale in all member states of foods containing levels of these chemicals exceeding the regulatory thresholds. As member states implement the regulation, Dyneon, a 3M subsidiary that operates the Gendorf facility in Germany, in coordination with local authorities and farmers, has proposed a pilot program of food sampling to determine if any remedial action is necessary.\nThe EU regulates PFAS in drinking water via a Drinking Water Directive, which includes a limit of 0.1 micrograms per liter (µg/l) (or 0.1 parts for billion (ppb)) for a sum of 20 PFAS in drinking water. January 2023 was the deadline for Member States to implement the Directive in their countries.\nDyneon has a recycling process for a critical emulsifier from which small amounts of PFOA are present after recycling, as an unintended and unavoidable byproduct of certain earlier process steps. With respect to the applicability of the amendment of the EU POPs Regulation with PFOA applicable since 2021, Dyneon proactively consulted with the relevant German competent authority regarding process improvements underway. The implementation of process improvements and analytical work is ongoing. Dyneon and the predecessor operators of the Gendorf facility have commissioned a voluntary feasibility study by an independent soil consultant and shared with the competent authority the initial study including soil management concept related to the Chemical Park in which Dyneon and other companies operate their plants.\n3M Belgium, a subsidiary of the Company, has been working with the Public Flemish Waste Agency (\"OVAM\") for several years to investigate and remediate historical PFAS contamination at and near the 3M Belgium facility in Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, Belgium. In connection with a ring road construction project (the Oosterweel Project) in Antwerp that involved extensive soil work, an investigative committee with judicial investigatory powers was formed in June 2021 by the Flemish Parliament to investigate PFAS found in the soil and groundwater near the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium testified at Flemish parliamentary committee hearings in September and December 2021 on PFAS- related matters. The Flemish Parliament, the Minister of the Environment, and regulatory authorities initiated investigations and demands for information related to the release of PFAS from the Zwijndrecht facility. The Company has cooperated with the authorities in the investigations and information requests and is working with the authorities on an ongoing basis, as they continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgium’s operations at the Zwijndrecht facility, as further discussed below. Separately, as previously disclosed, the Company is aware that certain residents of Zwijndrecht and non-governmental organizations filed a criminal complaint with an Antwerp investigatory judge against 3M Belgium, alleging it had unlawfully abandoned waste in violation of its environmental care obligations. Certain additional parties reportedly joined the complaint. 3M Belgium has not been served with any such complaint. In June 2023, the federal judicial police requested additional documents following earlier requests for documents that 3M Belgium had provided, and 3M Belgium has complied with the request for additional documents.\nSafety measures – wastewater discharge. In August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a safety measure requiring the capture of certain process wastewaters to prevent their entry into the site wastewater treatment plant. While 3M Belgium appealed the safety measure due to the belief it lacked adequate legal and factual foundation, 3M Belgium promptly implemented the required actions.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2021, the Province of Antwerp unilaterally adopted lower discharge limits for the nine PFAS compounds specifically identified in the water discharge permit for the Zwijndrecht facility and added a special condition that essentially prohibits discharge of any PFAS chemistry without a specific limit in the permit. 3M Belgium received a new two-year permit in May 2022 which contains strict new limits for 24 different PFAS, effective July 1, 2022. 3M Belgium believes that the recently installed additional control systems will enable it to meet these limits. Subsequently, the environmental enforcement agency informed 3M Belgium that the agency believes that 3M Belgium must apply for discharge limits for certain additional “short-chain” PFAS pursuant to the special condition. Although disagreeing with the agency’s position, 3M Belgium developed an application to amend the permit to add the additional PFAS. 3M Belgium has insufficient information to predict the limits that will be set forth for additional short-chain PFAS and is therefore unable to assess whether the current or future wastewater treatment system, as currently conceived, will meet future limits imposed. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate regarding the discharge of certain short chain PFAS compounds in wastewater from the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium previously identified these compounds and shared the results with the Inspectorate. The compounds at issue do not have specific discharge limits in the applicable wastewater discharge permit, and the infraction report references a special condition in the permit that prohibits detectable discharge of PFAS compounds that do not have a specific discharge limit in the permit. 3M Belgium disagrees with the Inspectorate’s interpretation of the special condition and the time period permitted for compliance with it. Moreover, 3M Belgium instituted a capturing process to prevent wastewaters containing short chain PFAS identified in the infraction report from entering the treatment system or its discharge. 3M Belgium notified the Inspectorate that complying with the special condition means ceasing the legally required extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. The Inspectorate acknowledged this fact but insisted that 3M Belgium continue to extract and treat groundwater. Groundwater treatment continues and 3M Belgium has applied for a modification of the water discharge permit to add parameters for the short chain PFAS. 3M Belgium will continue its efforts to comply with the special condition and to minimize discharge of all PFAS, including the PFAS identified in the infraction report, but an inability to meet discharge limits for short chain PFAS could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgium’s normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the facility, some of which may not be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could in turn impact these businesses’ ability to fulfill supply obligations to their customers.\nSafety measure – emissions. As previously disclosed, in October 2021, the Flemish environmental enforcement agency issued a new safety measure that prohibits all emissions of all forms of PFAS from the facility unless and until specifically approved on a process-by-process basis. 3M Belgium thereupon commenced an appeal process to the Council of States, seeking, among other things, urgent suspension of the safety measure during the pendency of the appeal process. At the same time, 3M Belgium complied with the safety measure by idling the affected production at the facility. The Council of States declined to grant urgent suspension of the safety measure. 3M Belgium established a regular cadence of meetings with the relevant authorities to review restart of specific PFAS-related production processes. The agency recently clarified that the safety measure applies to release of PFAS into water, and as such, reviews have been expanded as requested.\nIn October 2022, 3M Belgium received a report from the Flemish Inspectorate regarding certain health and safety issues noted during inspections of the Zwijndrecht facility in March 2022, alleging certain related deficiencies, some dating back to 2010. In December 2022, 3M Belgium provided the Inspectorate with responses to the allegations, including plans and timelines for compliance where applicable, and plans to continue to inform the Inspectorate on corrective actions to be taken.\nAs of July 2022, the authorities have approved the restart of key production processes and 3M Belgium continues to conduct required monitoring and reporting activities. Belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgium’s operations and compliance with applicable requirements at the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2022, the environmental enforcement agency issued an infraction report alleging that 3M Belgium had misconstrued an exemption in the safety measure and thus not fully complied with the safety measure in the operation of certain production lines. Discussions are underway with the environmental enforcement agency and those production lines are now being addressed in accordance with the review and approval provisions of the safety measure. In July 2023, the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate issued an infraction report stating the actions taken are insufficient to ensure all necessary measures to reduce dust formation from the facility, and seeking a response from 3M Belgium by August 1. 3M Belgium has implemented additional control measures to address potential dust formation and is working to outline more structural actions to reduce potential dust formation.\nAlthough the authorities have approved the restart and/or continued operation of key production processes, a negative development in their ongoing oversight review, such as the infraction reports referenced above, could impact or delay 3M Belgium's ability to fully restart all production processes, which in turn could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgium’s normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the facility, some of which may not be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could impact these businesses’ ability to fulfill supply obligations to their customers.\n34\nTable of Contents\nNotice of default – environmental law compliance. Also in September 2021, the Flemish Region issued a notice of default alleging violations of environmental laws and seeking PFAS-related information, indemnity and a remediation plan for soil and water impacts due to PFAS originating from the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2021, 3M responded to the notice of default and announced a plan to invest up to 125 million euros in the next three years in actions related to the Zwijndrecht community, including support for local commercial farmers impacted by restrictions on sale of agricultural products, and enhancements to site discharge control technologies. 3M is also committed to payment for ongoing off-site descriptive soil investigation and appropriate soil remediation. In March 2022, the Company announced an investment of 150 million euros to advance remedial actions to address legacy PFAS previously produced at the Zwijndrecht facility. An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has progressed towards a remedial action plan based on a descriptive soil investigation that would help inform 3M Belgium’s remedial actions onsite and in certain surrounding areas. 3M Belgium representatives continue to have discussions with the relevant authorities regarding further soil remedial actions in connection with the Flemish Soil Decree, which requires both public authorities and private parties to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater in Flanders.\nIn February 2023, OVAM rejected a required descriptive soil investigation (\"DSI\") submitted by 3M Belgium, required that a new DSI be submitted by the end of March, and also required that 3M Belgium propose a plan to implement additional precautionary measures for individuals living in designated areas near the Zwijndrecht plant. At the end of March 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a revised DSI, along with an appeal of the rejection of the DSI. In May 2023, OVAM confirmed the main findings of the DSI for certain zones and set an October 2023 deadline to submit a remedial action plan related to these zones. 3M Belgium also submitted a proposal regarding precautionary measures that is being discussed with OVAM. 3M Belgium submitted two additional DSIs in May 2023 for areas around the Zwijndrecht plant. In July 2023, an appeal was filed by a local NGO with the Flemish government regarding the additional DSIs.\nIn December 2022, the Flemish Cabinet took steps to implement an executive action (the “Site Decision”) designed to expand 3M’s remedial obligations around the Zwijndrecht site. On March 31, 2023, the Site Decision was fully approved by the Flemish Cabinet and the Site Decision was published in April 2023. While the full impact of the Site Decision remains to be determined, it appears to establish a remediation zone within 5 kilometers of Zwijndrecht, and may create a presently undetermined amount of additional financial and remedial obligations for 3M Belgium. In June 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the Site Decision to the Belgian Council of State.\nIn July 2022, 3M Belgium and the Flemish Government announced an agreement in connection with the Zwijndrecht facility. Pursuant to the agreement, 3M Belgium, among other things, committed an aggregate of 571 million euros, which includes the previous commitments described above. In aggregate, the commitment includes enhancements to site discharge control technologies, support for qualifying local farmers, amounts to address certain identified priority remedial actions (which may include supporting additional actions as required under the Flemish Soil Decree), funds to be used by the Flemish Government in its sole discretion in connection with PFAS emissions from the Zwijndrecht facility, and support for the Oosterweel Project in cash and support services. The agreement contains certain provisions ending current litigation and providing certain releases of liability for 3M, while recognizing that the Flemish Government retains its authority to act in the future to protect its citizenry, as specified in the agreement. In connection with these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $500 million in the first half of 2022, with approximately $355 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nCivil litigation - As of June 30, 2023, a total of eight actions against 3M Belgium are pending in Belgian civil courts, and 3M Belgium has received pre-litigation notices from individuals in Belgium indicating potential claims. The pending cases include claims by neighboring and other companies for alleged soil and wastewater or rainwater contamination with PFAS; and tort liability claims and an environmental injunction procedure by environmental NGOs and several hundred individuals. While most of the actions are in early stages, one of the actions, brought by a family living near the 3M Belgium plant, had a hearing in February 2023 and, in May 2023, the presiding judge awarded provisional damages in the amount of 500 euros each to four family members, and denied other damages. Another case, involving an environmental injunction procedure, was brought by environmental NGOs originally against 3M Belgium’s contractors and later against 3M Belgium and seeks to accelerate the descriptive soil investigation and remediation process. In May 2023, the court denied the environmental injunction claim, subject to appeal.\nIn May 2023, the Netherlands government sent 3M Belgium a notice of liability stating it holds 3M Belgium liable for damages related to alleged PFAS contamination in the Netherlands. The notice purports to identify claims by the Netherlands government and references potential damages to other parties. 3M Belgium plans to meet with the Netherlands government to discuss the notice. 3M Belgium has also met with representatives of some of the private parties involved, which have indicated they may separately pursue claims.\n35\nTable of Contents\nUnited States: Federal Activity\nIn the United States, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data studies of various PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS. In October 2021, EPA released its “PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024,” which presents EPA’s approach to PFAS, including investing in research to increase the understanding of PFAS, pursuing a comprehensive approach to proactively control PFAS exposures to humans and the environment, and broadening and accelerating the scope of clean-up of PFAS in the environment.\nIn June 2022, EPA released new final lifetime health advisory levels for PFBS (2,000 ppt) and HFPO-DA and its salts (“GenX”) (4 ppt), and new interim lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA (.004 ppt) and PFOS (.02 ppt). Lifetime health advisories are intended to provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration.\nIn March 2023, EPA published proposed national primary drinking water standards for six PFAS – PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA, along with an economic analysis including purported estimated costs of the proposed rule. For PFOA and PFOS, EPA has proposed a drinking water standard of 4 ppt. For the other four PFAS, EPA is proposing to adopt for the first time a drinking water standard based on a “hazard index” approach, under which the levels of those four compounds, if detected, would be input into an EPA-provided formula to determine whether they exceed EPA's cumulative risk threshold. 3M submitted comments on EPA’s proposal in May 2023. EPA has indicated that final rules will be published in January 2024. If the proposed drinking water standards are finalized, 3M could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.\nIn May 2021, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (\"ATSDR\") within the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a Toxicological Profile for certain PFAS that established minimal risk levels (\"MRLs\") for PFOS, PFOA and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs establish a screening level and are not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other agencies.\nIn May 2022, EPA added five PFAS substances – HFPO-DA, PFOS, PFOA PFNA, and PFHxS - to its list of Regional Screening and Removal Management Levels based on the May 2021 MRLs. EPA had previously added PFBS to both lists in 2014. Regional Screening Levels are used to identify contaminated media that may require further investigation, while Regional Removal Management Levels are used by EPA to support certain actions under CERCLA.\nIn November 2022, EPA published its final Drinking Water Contaminant Candidates List 5 (CCL 5), which includes a broad group of PFAS that are not currently subject to national primary drinking water regulations but which EPA is considering for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\"). In December 2022, EPA issued guidance to states for incorporating PFAS requirements into the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permit program, including recommendations to require PFAS monitoring and incorporating limits for PFAS in industrial discharges.\nIn October 2021, EPA announced it will initiate a rulemaking to designate four PFAS compounds as hazardous constituents under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"). EPA has announced it plans to issue the proposed rule in August 2023.\nIn September 2022, EPA published in the Federal Register its proposal to list PFOA and PFOS, including their salts and structural isomers, as CERCLA hazardous substances. 3M submitted comments on EPA’s proposal in November 2022. In June 2023, EPA indicated that the timeline for issuance of a final rule would be extended from August 2023 to February 2024. In addition, EPA’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking considering CERCLA hazardous substance designations for additional PFAS, including PFBS, PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, PFBA,perfluorohexanoic acid (\"PFHxA\"), PFDA and their precursor compounds as well as the precursor compounds of PFOS and PFOA, was published for public comment in April 2023 with comments due in August 2023.\nIf CERCLA or RCRA designations are finalized and become enforceable, 3M may be required to undertake additional investigative or remediation activities where 3M conducts operations or where 3M has disposed of waste. 3M may also face additional litigation from other entities that have liability under these laws for contribution to clean- up costs other entities might have.\nEPA has also taken several actions to increase reporting and restrictions regarding PFAS under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\"TSCA\") and the Toxics Release Inventory (\"TRI\"), which is a part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. EPA has added more than 170 PFAS compounds to the list of substances that must be included in TRI reports as of July 2021. In December 2022, EPA published a proposed rule to adding PFAS subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act to the list of Lower Thresholds for Chemicals of Special Concern, which would require TRI reporting of de minimis uses of those PFAS. 3M submitted comments to EPA’s proposal.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2023, EPA issued a test order under TSCA to manufacturers, including the Company, requiring them to conduct certain health and safety testing related to HFPO, a PFAS, and submit the results to EPA. 3M has submitted its initial response.\n3M is in the process of amending its 2020 TSCA Chemical Data Reporting rule report for 3M’s Cordova plant due to the discovery of relatively small amounts of HFPO formed as a commercial byproduct by the facility. This issue has been self-disclosed to EPA.\nIn June 2023, EPA notified 3M that it intends to issue a TSCA test order for HFPO-DAF, a PFAS, to 3M. 3M expects that test order to be issued in July or August 2023.\nIn April 2022, EPA released draft Aquatic Life Criteria for PFOA and PFOS. These criteria, once finalized, may be used by states in developing water quality standards for protection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act. 3M submitted comments on the draft criteria in July 2022.\nUnited States: State Activity\nSeveral state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS, and 3M has submitted various responsive comments. In Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Health (\"MDH\") in 2022 stated that Health Based Values (\"HBVs\") “are levels that the MDH considers safe for all people to consume, including sensitive populations.” The current HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA, 15 ppt for PFOS, 47 ppt for PFHxS, 7,000 ppt for PFBA, 200 ppt for PFHxA, and 100 ppt for PFBS.\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (\"MPCA\") published the final version of its PFAS Monitoring Plan in March 2022. Several 3M facilities - including Cottage Grove, Maplewood, Hutchinson, St. Paul, and Woodbury - are among the Minnesota facilities that are preliminarily scoped to be within the Monitoring Plan.\nStates with finalized drinking water standards for certain PFAS include California, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nSome other states have also been evaluating or have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS compounds in products such as food packaging, carpets and other products. For example, in June 2022, Colorado enacted a law which restricts the sale of certain consumer products, including carpets and furniture, fabric treatments, food packaging, and children’s products that contain intentionally added PFAS.\nIn October 2022, California passed legislation prohibiting the manufacture, distribution of sale of textiles and cosmetics containing certain PFAS. Additionally, in 2021 and 2022, California finalized its listing of PFOS (and its salts and transformation and degradation precursors) and PFOA as carcinogens, and PFNA as a reproductive toxicant under its Proposition 65 law. California has also proposed listing PFDA, PFHxS, and PFUNDA as reproductive toxicants under Proposition 65.\nIn the summer of 2021, the State of Maine passed its Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution, which bans intentionally added PFAS in products effective January 1, 2030 and requires broad reporting of products containing intentionally-added PFAS effective January 1, 2023. In December 2022, 3M submitted to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") a list of products containing intentionally added PFAS that have been sold in the U.S. in the past two years in compliance with the law. 3M submitted an updated copy of that list to the Maine DEP in May 2023. In June 2023, Maine enacted legislation retroactive to January 1, 2023, that includes certain changes to the notification requirement in the original legislation, including an extension of the compliance date until January 2025.\nIn May 2023, Minnesota enacted legislation that includes a broad PFAS prohibition and reporting statute. The statute requires product notifications starting in 2025 and a general prohibition on sales of PFAS-containing products no later than 2032 for all product categories, subject to exemptions that may be adopted by rulemaking. Several other states have introduced legislation that would impose similar obligations.\nIn October 2020, 3M and several other parties filed notices of appeal in the appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey to challenge the validity of the New Jersey PFOS and PFOA regulations. In January 2021, the appellate division of the court denied the group’s motion to stay the regulations. The court heard oral argument in November 2022.\nIn April 2021, 3M also filed a lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (\"EGLE\") to invalidate the drinking water standards EGLE promulgated under an accelerated timeline. In November 2022, the court granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on the merits and invalidated EGLE’s rule based on its failure to properly consider relevant costs. The court stayed the effect of its decision pending appeal. EGLE appealed the decision in December 2022, and the court scheduled oral argument in the case for July 2023.\n37\nTable of Contents\nBetween 2018 and 2022, seven states have enacted laws requiring written notification of firefighting personal protective equipment that contains PFAS, with most such laws providing for potential civil penalties for non-compliance. In November 2022, the Company identified it likely did not provide required notifications for some of its products, including its Scott Safety Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses. The Company began providing written notices with those products starting November 2022. In addition, the Company continues to work to determine the extent of any potential non-compliance, has made voluntary self-disclosures to states and customers as applicable, and has expressed its willingness to work with those states to address and resolve any potential non-compliance. The Company cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by those states.\nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions to the Company, including to its manufacturing operations and its products. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\nAs previously reported, 3M has resolved numerous claims relating to alleged PFAS contamination of properties and water supplies by 3M’s Decatur, Alabama manufacturing facility. In April 2019, 3M settled a lawsuit brought by the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority for $35 million, which will fund a new water filtration system, with 3M indemnifying the Water Authority from liability resulting from the resolution of certain lawsuits against the Water Authority alleging liability or damages related to 3M PFAS. In October 2021, 3M settled a class action brought by plaintiffs who were supplied drinking water by the Water Authority (the “Lindsey” case) for an immaterial amount. The court issued a final order approving the class settlement and dismissing the action in March 2022. In October 2021, 3M also reached agreements in principle to resolve litigation with several other parties, including previously disclosed Tennessee Riverkeeper organization, the St. John plaintiff class, and plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters. A court granted final approval of the St. John class settlement in April 2022, and plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters filed dismissals thereafter. In June 2022, the court dismissed the Tennessee Riverkeeper case with prejudice. In November 2021, 3M and the City of Decatur, Decatur Utilities and Morgan County executed a collaborative agreement under which the Company agreed to contribute approximately $99 million and also to continue to address certain PFAS-related matters in the area. The contribution relates to initiatives to improve the quality of life and overall environment in Decatur, including community redevelopment and recreation projects by the City, County and Decatur Utilities. It also includes addressing certain PFAS matters at the Morgan County landfill and reimbursement of costs previously incurred related to PFAS remediation. 3M will continue to address PFAS at certain other closed municipal sites at which the Company historically disposed waste and continue environmental characterization in the area. This work will complement the Interim Consent Order that 3M entered with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (“ADEM\") in 2020 and includes sampling of environmental media, such as ground water, regarding the potential presence of PFAS at the 3M Decatur facility and legacy disposal sites, as well as supporting the execution of appropriate remedial actions. In March 2022, 3M reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the Billings matter, resulting in dismissal of the case in August 2022. In August 2022, 3M reached an agreement to settle personal injury claims brought by 37 individual plaintiffs in the King matter. 3M continues to negotiate with individual property owners regarding claims relating to former 3M disposal sites and has resolved several such claims for an immaterial amount.\nIn September 2020, the City of Guin Water Works and Sewer Board (\"Guin WWSB\") brought a lawsuit against 3M in Alabama state court alleging that PFAS contamination in the Guin water system stems from manufacturing operations at 3M’s Guin facility and disposal activity at a nearby landfill. Guin WWSB dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice in order to work with 3M to further investigate the presence of chemicals in the area; and in December 2021, the parties reached a settlement under which 3M agreed to contribute $30 million that will be used on a new treatment system for Guin’s drinking water and a new wastewater treatment facility.\nIn August 2022, Colbert County, Alabama, which opted out of the St. John settlement, filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River, from which the County withdraws its drinking water. Defendants' joint motion to dismiss was denied in December 2022, and defendants have filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court of Alabama, which remains pending. The case is in early stages of discovery.\nIn February 2023, the City of Muscle Shoals, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River, from which the City withdraws its drinking water. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in March 2023. Also in February 2023, two individuals who opted out of the St. John class settlement filed suit in Alabama state court against 3M, alleging PFAS contamination of their property resulting from 3M’s operations in Decatur. 3M removed the case to federal court and answered the complaint in March 2023. The case is in early stages of discovery.\n38\nTable of Contents\nState Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS\nAs previously reported, several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against 3M and other defendants that are now pending in a federal Multi-District Litigation (\"MDL\") court in South Carolina regarding Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), described further below. The lawsuits generally seek, on a state-wide basis: injunctive relief, investigative and remedial work, compensatory damages, natural resource damages, attorneys’ fees, and, where available, punitive damages related to the states’ response to PFAS contamination. Currently in the AFFF MDL, state attorneys general lawsuits have been brought against 3M on behalf of the people of the states of Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin, as well as on behalf of the people of the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Since March 2023, attorneys general have also brought suit against 3M on behalf of the people of Arizona, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine (a second case, a purported “non-AFFF” case), Maryland (both AFFF and purported “non-AFFF” cases), New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\nThere are also multiple state attorneys general lawsuits that are proceeding outside the AFFF MDL, as described below.\nNew Jersey. In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed two actions against 3M, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (“DuPont”), and Chemours Co. (\"Chemours\") on behalf of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (\"NJDEP\"), the NJDEP’s commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges at two DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In June 2020, the court consolidated the two actions, along with two others brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities, for case management and pretrial purposes. The parties are conducting discovery. As of March 2023, the actions are stayed pending the parties’ participation in court-mandated mediation.\nNew Hampshire. In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The Company recently removed the other case to federal court and attempted to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this juncture in the litigation. In March 2023, the federal judge granted the state’s motion to remand the case back to state court. 3M has appealed that decision.\nVermont. In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state’s drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The other suit asserts PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several entities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. In late 2022, the complaint was amended to add claims related to PFBS and GenX and to add a claim under Vermont’s Waste Management Act, which had been amended to add manufacturers as liable parties for the release or threatened release of hazardous materials (which in Vermont includes certain PFAS compounds). This suit is proceeding in state court, where the parties are engaging in discovery and the court has set a trial-ready date in October 2024.\nIllinois. In March 2022, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court against 3M alleging contamination of the state's natural resources by PFAS compounds disposed of by, or discharged, or emitted from 3M's Cordova plant. The complaint requests monetary damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, a testing program, and a public outreach and information sharing program. The case was removed to federal court and 3M moved to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this stage in the litigation. The state has moved to remand the case back to state court, which remains pending. In January 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a new lawsuit against 3M and other defendants in Illinois state court, alleging contamination of a number of drinking water systems and natural resource damages at several sites statewide, and seeking to recover monetary damages, injunctive relief for remediation, civil penalties and other relief. The complaint states that the Attorney General is not seeking damages for AFFF by this lawsuit. The case has been removed to federal court and, in June 2023, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) transferred the case to the AFFF MDL. In April 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit against 3M and other defendants alleging PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF.\nCalifornia. The Company removed the previously-disclosed lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General to federal court and sought to have it transferred to the AFFF MDL.\nMaine. In March 2023, Maine’s Attorney General filed two lawsuits in state court against 3M and other defendants that contain allegations related to PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF and non-AFFF products, respectively. As described above, the AFFF lawsuit was removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. 3M has removed the other lawsuit to federal court, where it has moved to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL, and the State has filed a motion for remand.\n39\nTable of Contents\nMaryland. In May 2023, Maryland’s Attorney General filed two lawsuits in state court against 3M and other defendants that contain allegations related to PFAS contamination of state natural resources from AFFF and non-AFFF products, respectively.\nIn addition to the above state attorneys general actions, several other states and the District of Columbia, through their attorneys general, have announced selection processes to retain outside law firms to bring PFAS-related lawsuits against certain manufacturers including the Company. In addition, the Company is in discussions with several state attorneys general and agencies, responding to information and other requests relating to PFAS matters and exploring potential resolution of some of the matters raised.\nAqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and marketed AFFF containing certain PFAS for use in firefighting from approximately 1963 to 2002. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 4,996 lawsuits (including approximately 46 putative class actions and 451 public water system cases) alleging injuries or damages from PFAS contamination or exposure allegedly caused by AFFF use have been filed against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state and federal courts. As further described below, a vast majority of these pending cases are in a federal MDL court in South Carolina. Additional AFFF cases continue to be filed in or transferred to the MDL. Claims in the MDL are asserted by individuals, public water systems, putative class members, state and territorial sovereigns, and other entities. Plaintiffs seek a variety of relief in cases in the MDL, including, where applicable, damages for personal injury, property damage, water treatment costs, medical monitoring, natural resource damages, and punitive damages. The Company also continues to defend certain AFFF cases that remain in state court and is in discussions with pre-suit claimants for possible resolutions where appropriate.\nAFFF MDL and Water System Cases\nIn December 2018, the JPML granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Over the past four years, the parties in the MDL have conducted substantial discovery, including ongoing master discovery and several rounds of discovery involving potential water supplier bellwether cases.\nIn the MDL, there are cases filed by approximately 451 public water systems (\"PWS\"). These include community water systems, which are public water systems that provide water for human use and consumption to a set population, and non-community water systems, which are public water systems that supply water to a varied population (for example, campgrounds or schools). There are approximately 50,000 community water systems in the United States. The MDL cases focus on AFFF, but the MDL also contains a number of cases with allegations related to the broader category of PFAS products. 3M and other defendants also face cases filed by approximately 55 public water systems outside of the MDL. Public water system cases include a variety of claims, including for product liability, negligence, and public nuisance. The cases seek damages for, among other things, remediation costs to remove PFAS from drinking water provided to communities, as well as punitive damages. The MDL court has repeatedly encouraged the parties in the MDL to negotiate to resolve cases, including these PWS cases. In October 2022, the court appointed a retired federal judge as mediator.\nOn June 22, 2023, 3M entered into a proposed class-action settlement to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States (“PWS Settlement”), subject to court approval. Eligible class members are United States public water systems as defined in the PWS Settlement. Subject to court approval, the PWS Settlement would resolve the portion of the MDL that involves PWS drinking water claims in the United States by providing funding for treatment technologies to PWS that have tested positive for PFAS, funding for future testing, and funding for systems that test positive in the future.\nUnder the PWS Settlement, class members would agree to release 3M from any claim arising out of, relating to, or involving (i) PFAS that has entered or may enter drinking water or the class member’s water system; (ii) the development, manufacture, formulation, distribution, sale, transportation, storage, loading, mixing, application, or use of PFAS or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS; (iii) the transport, disposal, or arrangement for disposal of PFAS-containing waste or PFAS- containing wastewater, or a class member’s use of PFAS-containing water for irrigation or manufacturing; or (iv) representations about PFAS or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS. The PWS Settlement would also require class members to release punitive- or exemplary-damages claims that arise out of conduct occurring at least in part before the PWS Settlement’s effective date and that relate to PFAS or any product (including AFFF) manufactured with or containing PFAS.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIf the court approves the PWS Settlement and all conditions in the PWS Settlement are met, 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023. The charge reflects the present value (discounted at an estimated 5.2% interest rate at time of proposed settlement) of the expected $12.5 billion nominal value of 3M’s payments under the PWS Settlement. The PWS Settlement calls for 3M to make payments annually from 2024 through 2036. The actual amounts that 3M will pay will be determined in part by which, if any, class members that do not have a positive test result for the presence of PFAS in their drinking water (as defined by the PWS Settlement) as of the date of the PWS Settlement receive such a test result by the end of 2025.\nThe PWS Settlement gives 3M the option to terminate the PWS Settlement if the numbers of eligible class members opting out of the Settlement exceed specified levels. The PWS Settlement provides that 3M does not admit any liability or wrongdoing and does not waive any defenses. The Settlement remains subject to preliminary and final approval from the MDL court.\nThe previously disclosed case filed by the City of Stuart, Florida that was selected by the MDL court as the first bellwether trial was also settled as a part of the PWS Settlement.\nThe MDL court has also directed the parties to submit a proposal for an initial set of personal injury bellwether cases. The MDL court has indicated that the parties will be expected to begin discovery on a set of 28 cases to be selected as potential personal injury bellwether cases. In September 2022, the court issued an order denying defendants’ MDL-wide summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense, which defense can be presented to a jury at future trials.\nOutside the MDL, trial was also scheduled to occur in June 2023 in a lawsuit brought by the City of Rome, Georgia, which asserted claims against 3M and other defendants for compensatory damages, statutory damages for alleged violation of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and injunctive relief. The parties reached a settlement agreement to resolve the case and, under the terms of the PWS Settlement, associated estimated payments factor in amounts related to the City of Rome settlement. The PWS Settlement amounts discussed above therefore include the City of Rome settlement.\nOther AFFF Cases\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL, and one case was voluntarily dismissed. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are stayed by agreement of the parties.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company is aware of approximately 185 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. 3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, several cases are expected to remain pending in state courts.\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\nOther PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M’s customers’ improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc. (\"Wolverine\"), Georgia-Pacific LLC, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet manufacturers.\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will fall under the PWS Settlement if the water providers do not opt out of the PWS Settlement.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIn New York, 3M is defending 40 individual cases filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and five additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. and DuPont. Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non-3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. Plaintiffs in both the federal and state individual cases assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. A mediation involving plaintiffs from 32 of the federal and state cases and all of the defendants was held in April 2023. 3M and certain of the other defendants have agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs involved in the mediation, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3M’s share is not considered material. These cases will continue to move forward as to certain remaining defendants, and the other remaining cases continue. Additionally, 3M is defending a case in New York state court filed by the Town of Petersburgh in September 2022. Plaintiff alleges that 3M and several other manufacturers contributed to PFOA contamination in the town’s public water supply. Oral argument on a motion to dismiss that was filed by 3M and the other defendants is scheduled for July 2023. 3M is also defending 22 individual cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers, including 9 new complaints filed on behalf of additional water districts during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs’ water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. 3M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine. The action arose from Wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine’s shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M’s product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. 3M and Wolverine agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs, and 3M's share is not considered material; the court approved the class settlement in March 2023 and 3M's final payment related to the settlement was made in June 2023.\nIn Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending two state court cases brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3M’s sale of PFAS- containing products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. The plaintiffs in these two water utilities cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Centre, Alabama and Rome, Georgia. The Centre case has been set for trial in November 2023.The City of Rome case had been scheduled for trial in June 2023, as discussed in more detail above but, the case resolved by settlement between the parties shortly before trial. Another case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. That case continues, with class certification and other motions recently briefed.\nIn April 2023, another case that included similar allegations was filed by Shelby County, Alabama, and Talladega County, Alabama, against 3M and other defendants. Those cases have been removed to federal court, where they are proceeding through discovery.\n3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery, which has been extended by the court through November 2023.\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022, which was granted in part and denied in part in February 2023. The claims that will proceed against 3M and other defendants, including negligence, wantonness, and public nuisance, are moving into discovery.\nIn California, 3M, Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities were named as defendants in an action brought in state court by the City of Corona and a local utility authority, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs’ water sources and also referring to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of contamination. The court granted demurrers filed by Decra and the DuPont entities, while 3M answered the complaint in February 2022. This case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL. In October 2022, a putative class action was filed against the Company and other parties on behalf of individuals who have been drinking water from the Temescal Subbasin, from which the City of Corona gets its water, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and medical monitoring. This case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn Delaware, 3M, is defending one putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case was removed to federal court, and in September 2022, the court dismissed all but plaintiffs’ negligence claim. Plaintiffs have filed a third amended complaint which 3M moved to dismiss in December 2022. This motion has been fully briefed and is pending the court decision.\nIn New Jersey, 3M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, a publicly traded water utility serving customers in and around certain portions of Middlesex County, New Jersey, which alleges PFAS contamination of its water system. The Court denied 3M’s motion for summary judgment in October 2022 and a trial date has been set for October 2, 2023. The parties are exploring potential resolution in advance of trial. In September 2020, 3M was named a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the Pequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is scheduled to commence in June 2023 (Hopatcong) and July 2023 (Pequannock).\n3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 27 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. 3M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in ten cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3M’s share is not considered material. Plaintiffs in the 17 remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their disabled adult children. In July 2022, plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against defendants other than 3M, which motion was denied by the court. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of these cases. In December 2022, an additional personal injury case was filed in New Jersey State court.\n3M and Middlesex Water Company are also defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November 2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFAS. The court denied 3M’s motion to dismiss, and the case is proceeding through discovery. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative class action of the state residents who are customers of the water company, seeking indemnity from the Company. After Middlesex Water Company removed the case to federal court in July 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. The federal court remanded the case back to state court in April 2023 and 3M has since answered the third-party complaint. In March 2023, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M by another Middlesex Water Company customer. In May 2023, 3M filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims in that lawsuit.\nIn South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges property damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey & Lord plant from 1966 until 2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in December 2022, which 3M has moved to dismiss.\nIn Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by local paper manufacturing facilities. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of Westminster. This case was removed to federal court. In February 2023, the federal court consolidated this action with a previously-filed federal case involving similar allegations and claims against 3M’s co-defendants. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting claims against 3M. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in March 2023.\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as defendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills. The lawsuit seeks to recover for alleged property damage. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint limiting the scope of their claims to allegations pertaining to one paper mill and three defendants that allegedly supplied PFAS-containing products to that mill, including 3M. 3M has moved to dismiss this case.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order “establishing an independent panel of scientists” to evaluate PFAS. In March 2022, the court certified a class of \"[i]ndividuals subject to the laws of Ohio, who have 0.05 [ppt] of PFOA (C-8) and at least 0.05 ppt of any other PFAS in their blood serum.\" The judge ordered additional briefing to permit defendants to narrow the proposed nationwide class by “show[ing] what states do not recognize the type of claim for relief filed by” the plaintiff. In September 2022, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants’ request to appeal the district court’s class certification order. Defendants’ appeal is now fully briefed.\nOther PFAS-related Matters\nIn July 2019, the Company received a written request from the Subcommittee on Environment of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, seeking certain documents and information relating to the Company’s manufacturing and distribution of PFAS products. In September 2019, a 3M representative testified before and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Company’s environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company continues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.\nThe Company continues to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants.\nAs previously reported, the Illinois EPA in August 2014 approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results. In June 2022, the Illinois EPA provided notice of the termination of the Cordova May 2000 Site Remediation Agreement. The Company continues to perform pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results to Illinois EPA. In addition, the Company is treating its pumped groundwater at its Cordova wastewater treatment plant.\nIn Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a HBV or Health Risk Limit (\"HRL\") (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the MDH to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. In August 2009, the MPCA issued a decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. In the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the approved remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites, and in late 2010, 3M commenced the approved remedial option at the Oakdale site. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\nIn Alabama, as previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the ADEM to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEM’s agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on- site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below.\nThe Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal TSCA (the “2009 TSCA consent order”) for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that prohibits release of these materials into “the waters of the United States.” In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires monthly and quarterly reporting on the quality and quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.\nAs previously reported, as part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM temporarily idled certain manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur, and installed wastewater treatment controls. The Company restarted idled processes in October 2019.\nAs a result of the Company’s discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, as previously reported, 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company’s Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Company’s principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable.\nAs previously reported, in December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River. The Company is cooperating and providing responsive documents with respect to this and other inquiries regarding its manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, as previously reported, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its Cordova, Illinois facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cordova facility. In November 2019, the Company disclosed this matter to the EPA, and in January 2020 disclosed this matter to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (\"IEPA\"), submitted an NPDES permit application for the PFAS in its discharge, put on-line and in operation wastewater treatment specifically designed to treat PFAS. The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA to address these issues from the Cordova facility. In November 2022, the Company entered into an SDWA Administrative Consent Order that requires the Company to continue to sample and survey private and public drinking water wells within the vicinity of the Cordova facility, provide treatment of private water wells within a three-mile radius of the Cordova facility, and to provide alternate treatment/supply for the Camanche, Iowa public drinking water system. The Company continues to work with EPA and the City of Camanche as it implements the SDWA Administrative Consent Order.\nIn April 2022, the Company received a TSCA information request from EPA seeking information related to the operation of specific PFAS-related processes, and the Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information. In May 2022, the Company received a notice of potential violation and opportunity to confer and a notice of intent to file a complaint from EPA alleging violations of the RCRA related to the use of emergency spill containment units associated with certain chemical processes at the Cordova facility. In July 2023, 3M received from the EPA a draft of a federal administrative order for discussion, which would require 3M to determine the nature and extent of PFAS contamination around its Cordova facility, among other items.\nThe Company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as the plant in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, to ensure those operations are in compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and Company policies and procedures. As a result of these reviews, as previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility. In March 2020, the Company disclosed this matter to the MPCA and the EPA. In July 2020, the Company received an information request from MPCA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the Clean Water Act at its Cottage Grove facility. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information.\n45\nTable of Contents\nSeparately, as previously reported, in June 2020, the Company reported to EPA and MPCA that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and waste stream profile verification process of the Waste and Feedstream Analysis Plan (WAP/FAP) of its RCRA permit for its Cottage Grove incinerator. The Company and MPCA resolved the issues associated with the foregoing disclosure in a May 2022 stipulation agreement, and permanently retired the Cottage Grove hazardous waste incinerator in December 2021. In connection with the now closed incinerator, the Company in December 2022 received from EPA a draft Consent Agreement and Penalty Order under the Clean Air Act, with a proposed civil penalty to resolve issues raised in a Finding of Violation issued in 2019. The Company and EPA resolved this matter in which the Company has agreed to pay an administrative civil penalty. In October 2021, the Company received information requests from MPCA seeking additional toxicological and other information related to certain PFAS compounds. The Company is cooperating with these inquires and is producing documents and information in response to the requests. In June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility. The Company worked with MPCA to develop a plan to address its stormwater, which is embodied in an order issued by MPCA in December 2022. MPCA issued to the Company a Notice of Violation in March 2023, alleging that the Company is discharging stormwater containing PFAS at the 3M’s facility in Hutchinson, Minnesota. The Company is working with MPCA regarding the allegations in the Notice of Violation.\nIn February 2020, as previously reported, the Company received an information request from EPA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Company’s compliance with the Clean Water Act at its facilities that manufacture, process, and use PFAS, including the Decatur, Cordova, and Cottage Grove facilities, and the Company has completed its production of responsive documents and information.\nThe Company continues to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it conducts these reviews and responds to information, inspection, and other requests from the agencies. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters, what actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies or the potential consequences to the Company.\nOther Environmental Litigation\nIn July 2018, the Company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of two commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.\nFor environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise described below, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. The Company’s environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During the first six months of 2023, as a result of ongoing review and recent developments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation (including the proposed PWS Settlement), the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $10.3 billion and made related payments of $38 million. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had recorded liabilities of $10.9 billion for “other environmental liabilities.” These amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within other current liabilities ($0.3 billion) and other liabilities ($10.6 billion). The accruals represent the Company’s estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related matters and litigation described above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n46\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had recorded liabilities of $32 million for estimated non-PFAS related “environmental remediation” costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.\nThe Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was $8 million. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless, as discussed below, face litigation from approximately 239,000 claimants. As noted in the Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies section above, in July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters and those described in the earlier section Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies. 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund this trust and committed an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company would provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities. Related to these actions, which represented a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M. Upon the filings in late July 2022 in the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, all litigation against Aearo Entities that filed chapter 11 cases was automatically stayed.\nThe Aearo Entities also requested that the Bankruptcy Court confirm that Combat Arms Earplugs litigation against the Company was also stayed or order it enjoined. In August 2022, the Bankruptcy Court denied Aearo’s motion for a preliminary injunction to stay all Combat Arms related litigation against 3M. In September 2022, the bankruptcy judge certified Aearo’s request to appeal the decision directly to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and in October the Seventh Circuit accepted the appeal. In December 2022, Aearo filed its opening brief with the Seventh Circuit appealing the bankruptcy court’s decision. Oral argument took place in April 2023.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2023, the plaintiffs filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy filings of the Aearo Entities. In June 2023, the Bankruptcy Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss. As a result of this dismissal, the Court’s previous stay on the Aearo Combat Arms and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation was lifted. Also in June 2023, the bankruptcy judge certified a direct appeal of the motion to dismiss decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Aearo has appealed the decision.\nAs a result of the June 2023 bankruptcy dismissal, 3M reconsolidated the former deconsolidated Aearo Entities, in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in an immaterial income statement impact. A summary of affected material consolidated balance sheet amounts is included at the end of this Combat Arms litigation discussion.\nPreceding Combat Arms Earplugs matters:\nIn December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M’s Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs – Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages.\nIn April 2019, the JPML granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion and denied the defendants’ summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs’ claims are not barred by the government contractor defense. The court denied the Company’s request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate three plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021.\nIn April 2021, 3M received an adverse jury verdict in the first bellwether trial. The jury awarded the three plaintiffs less than $1 million in compensatory damages and $6 million in punitive damages for a total of $7 million. 3M appealed the verdicts, challenging, among other rulings, the MDL court's denial of 3M’s motion to assert the government contractor defense. The next two bellwether trials occurred in May and June of 2021. In May 2021, 3M received a verdict in its favor in the second bellwether trial, in which a jury rejected claims that 3M knowingly sold earplugs with design defects. In June 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the third bellwether trial. The jury found 3M liable for strict liability failure to warn, but found 3M not liable for design defect or fraud. The jury apportioned fault 62 percent to 3M and 38 percent to the plaintiff for a total damage award of approximately $1 million. 3M appealed the verdict. In October 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the fourth bellwether trial, in which a jury awarded $8 million to the plaintiff. 3M received verdicts in its favor in the fifth and sixth bellwether trials. 3M received an adverse verdict in the seventh and eighth bellwether trials, in which the juries awarded the plaintiffs $13 million and $23 million, respectively. A post-trial order reduced the award in the seventh bellwether trial to $8 million. 3M prevailed in the ninth and tenth bellwether cases but received adverse verdicts in the eleventh bellwether case in which the jury awarded each of the two plaintiffs $15 million in compensatory and $40 million in punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory and punitive damages award to one of the plaintiffs from $55 million to $22 million. 3M received adverse verdicts in the twelfth and thirteenth bellwether cases in which the jury awarded one plaintiff with $50 million and another with $8 million in compensatory damages. 3M prevailed in the fourteenth bellwether trial. Plaintiff in the fourteenth bellwether trial has filed a notice of appeal. In December 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her Eleventh Circuit appeal of a jury verdict in favor of 3M and Aearo. No other cases that resulted in a defense verdict are on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit at this time. In April 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff’s verdict in the fifteenth bellwether trial, awarding $2.2 million in compensatory damages and declining to award punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory damages award to $1.2 million. In May 2022, a jury returned a plaintiff’s verdict in the last scheduled federal bellwether trial. The jury awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $72 million in punitive damages.\nThe above referenced 16 bellwether trial results do not include several bellwether cases that plaintiffs' counsel dismissed with prejudice either during discovery or after being set for trial.\nThe Company's appeals to the Eleventh Circuit from the adverse verdicts of the first and third bellwether trials as noted above are proceeding forward. Oral argument on the two appeals occurred in May 2023 and the Company expects a decision later in 2023.\nAs previously disclosed, following conclusion of the bellwether trial process and unsuccessful settlement discussions, and with another 2,000 cases being prepared for trial while the Company's appeals are still pending, the Aearo Entities and the Company adopted a change in strategy for managing these alleged litigation liabilities that led to the Aearo Entities initiating the chapter 11 proceedings as discussed above.\n48\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits (including 14 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 151,000 individual claimants making similar allegations.\nAn administrative docket of approximately 88,000 unfiled and unverified claims has also been maintained at the MDL court. With respect to the administrative docket, the MDL court in August 2021 provided notice of an intent to issue forthcoming transition orders requiring all claims be moved off the administrative docket to the active docket on a rolling basis over 12 months. The orders will provide that any case not moved to the active docket will be dismissed without prejudice, and the administrative docket will then be closed. The MDL court also ordered the parties to prepare for trial 2,000 cases in four waves of 500 cases over the next 14 months. After the preparation of these cases is completed, the cases will be remanded to the federal district courts where the cases were originally filed. In October 2022, the MDL court ordered that while the successor liability issue described below is on appeal, all wave discovery would be stayed, the transition of cases from the administrative docket to the active docket would stop, and that monthly settlement conferences involving all parties (except Aearo) would occur in the MDL.\nThe MDL court ordered a three-day mediation in July 2022; and again in September 2022, a two-day mediation session. In January 2023, the MDL judge ordered that the MDL mediation would stop while the bankruptcy court mediation was ongoing.\nIn May 2023, plaintiffs in the MDL filed a motion to lift the stay on 13 cases, which motion is pending, and the MDL court issued an order identifying 31 cases that would be the first cases to be remanded for trial. In August 2022, subsequent to Aearo’s chapter 11 filing, the MDL court issued an order prohibiting 3M from attempting to relitigate issues in the bankruptcy court and from financially supporting any collateral dispute regarding the MDL court’s previous rulings. 3M has appealed the order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and made a motion to stay the order pending appeal. In October 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted 3M’s motion to stay the order pending appeal. The Eleventh Circuit heard oral argument for this appeal in June 2023.\nIn September 2022, two MDL plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking to permanently enjoin 3M from transferring assets, issuing dividends or completing the announced spin-off of its Health Care business, to allegedly preserve assets for the Combat Arms claimants. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and an opposition to the injunction motion. In December 2022, the court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Also in December 2022, the MDL court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment that successor liability, claiming that 3M is fully and independently liable for injuries allegedly caused by the CAEv2 and certified the order for appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. In January 2023, 3M sought the Eleventh Circuit’s acceptance of the appeal. Activity in the MDL is stayed pending resolution of this appeal. In June 2023, the MDL court lifted the stay as to the Aearo Entities but the MDL stay pending resolution of the Eleventh Circuit’s acceptance of the appeal of the successor liability decision remains in place.\n3M is also defending lawsuits brought primarily by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal court, and the federal court remanded them to state court in March 2020. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in October 2021 that the cases brought by non-military plaintiffs were properly remanded to state court, whereas the cases brought by military contractor plaintiffs who had received the Combat Arms Earplugs from the military should have remained in federal court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit granted 3M's unopposed motion to vacate the remand orders in the remaining appeals of military service member cases. The military service member cases are expected to be remanded to federal court and transferred to the MDL. There are approximately 40 lawsuits involving approximately 1,000 plaintiffs pending in the state court. The state court cases are subject to a bellwether case selection process. The first trial in Hennepin County is scheduled to start in August 2023.\nIn May 2023, the federal and state MDL courts issued orders providing that mediation would resume, and appointing additional mediators. The parties participated in multiple mediation sessions and discussions in May, June and July 2023. The substance of the ongoing mediation discussions is confidential pursuant to the courts' mediation orders. Attempts to comprehensively resolve with finality all Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities and 3M outside of the bankruptcy proceedings and in a litigation settlement involve significant challenges that could cause the Company to incur substantial and material costs.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOther than 3M’s funding commitment of approximately $1.0 billion relative to Combat Arms earplugs for its Aearo subsidiaries’ chapter 11 proceedings as described above and associated expenses, no liability has been recorded for the Combat Arms earplugs litigation because the Company believes any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. The accrued liability for the approximate $1.0 billion commitment is reflected within contingent liability claims and other (within other liabilities) on 3M’s consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, as a result of reconsolidation in the second quarter of 2023 of the former deconsolidated Aearo Entities, the following balances on 3M’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 do not appear on the comparative consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023:\n•\n$0.7 billion asset balance in equity and other investments (within other assets), reflecting 3M's equity investment interest in the entities. $0.6 billion net liability for former intercompany amounts due from 3M to the deconsolidated entities. The gross balances were reflected in other liabilities ($0.9 billion) and other assets ($0.3 billion).\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company was a named defendant in approximately 5,493 lawsuits in the United States and one Canadian putative class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system caused a surgical site infections in various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries.\nThe plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.\nThe JPML consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in an MDL proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs’ causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. A panel of the appellate court in August 2021 reversed the district court’s exclusion of the plaintiffs’ causation experts and the grant of summary judgment for 3M. The Company sought further appellate en banc review by the full Eighth Circuit court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit court denied 3M’s petition for rehearing en banc. In February 2022, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. In May 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court declined 3M’s request to review the Eighth Circuit court’s decision. The MDL court has not yet issued a new case management order. Separately, in August 2021, the Eighth Circuit court affirmed the 2018 jury verdict in 3M’s favor in the only bellwether trial in the MDL.\nIn February 2022, the MDL court ordered the parties to engage in any mediation sessions that a court-appointed mediator deems appropriate. Mediation sessions took place in May and August 2022 without success in resolving the litigation. The MDL court has assigned a new mediator to facilitate discussions of the litigation and possible resolution. In April 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion to disqualify the judge and magistrate judge overseeing the MDL. The motion was denied by both the district court judge and magistrate judge. The plaintiffs appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss the magistrate judge to the district court and the parties are awaiting a ruling on the appeal.\nIn addition to the federal cases, there are eight state court cases relating to the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. Three are pending in Missouri state court and combine Bair Hugger™ product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. One of the Missouri cases was tried in September and October of 2022; the jury returned a verdict in 3M’s favor on all the claims. The trial court denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. Another Missouri case is scheduled for trial in September 2024. There is also one case in Etowah County, Alabama that combines Bair Hugger™ product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. There have been state court cases filed in Pennsylvania and Montana that 3M has removed or will seek to remove to federal court and seek to have transferred to the MDL. 3M resolved for an immaterial amount the final state court case, which was filed in Hidalgo County, Texas.\nAs previously disclosed, 3M had been named a defendant in 61 cases in Minnesota state court. In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded plaintiffs’ experts and granted 3M’s motion for summary judgment on general causation. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition for review and entered the final dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases. The Company is also a defendant in a Ramsey County, Minnesota putative class action filed in June 2023 on behalf of patients who claim to have used the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system alleging economic damages relating to representations made about the system. The Company has moved to dismiss the Ramsey County matter and anticipates a ruling later in 2023.\n50\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims were due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL.\nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\nSecurities and Shareholder Litigation\nIn July 2019, Heavy & General Laborers’ Locals 472 & 172 Welfare Fund filed a putative securities class action against 3M Company, its former Chairman and CEO, current Chairman and CEO, and former CFO in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2019, an individual plaintiff filed a similar putative securities class action in the same district. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding 3M's exposure to liability associated with PFAS and bring claims for damages under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all defendants, and under Section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 against the individual defendants. In October 2019, the court consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs. In January 2020, the defendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In August 2020, the court denied the motion to transfer venue, and in September 2020, the defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In November 2020, the federal Court of Appeals granted 3M’s petition for a writ of mandamus and directed the New Jersey federal court to transfer the action to the Minnesota federal court. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action in January 2021, and in September 2021, the Minnesota federal court granted 3M’s motion to dismiss the securities class action, which judgment is now final.\nIn October 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives and directors. In November and December 2019, two additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a Minnesota state court. The derivative lawsuits rely on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The Minnesota state court cases were consolidated and stayed pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in the securities class action, and the Minnesota state plaintiffs have agreed to further stay their action pending a decision on the motion to dismiss the federal derivative lawsuit discussed below. In October 2020, the derivative action pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey was dismissed, without prejudice, for failure to serve the complaint within the required time period. In May 2023, the Minnesota court dismissed the Minnesota state derivative action.\nIn August 2020, a stockholder who had previously submitted a books and records demand filed an additional follow-on derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives and directors. This derivative lawsuit, having been transferred to Minnesota federal court, also relies on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. In February 2021, an additional stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the District of Minnesota, making similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The Minnesota federal court consolidated these federal derivative suits and stayed them pending and through any appeal of the securities class action dismissal. The Minnesota federal plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint in February 2022. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated federal derivative action in May 2022, and the court dismissed the case in March 2023, which judgment is now final.\nFederal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation\nIn October 2019, 3M acquired Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, including Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. As previously disclosed in the SEC filings by the KCI entities, in 2009, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. In 2011, following the completion of the government’s review and its decision declining to intervene in two qui tam actions described further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs’ pleadings were unsealed.\nThe government inquiry followed two qui tam actions filed in 2008 by two former employees against Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. (collectively, the “KCI defendants”) under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. As 3M has previously disclosed, one qui tam action (the Godecke case) was dismissed in January 2022. In the remaining action (the Hartpence case), the complaint contains allegations that the KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for V.A.C.® Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors and seeks monetary damages.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2019, the district court entered summary judgment in the KCI Defendants’ favor on all of the relator-plaintiff’s claims. The relator-plaintiff then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument in the Hartpence case was held in July 2020. The appellate court issued an opinion in August 2022 reversing the decision of the district court and remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court held a status conference in January 2023 where no case deadlines were set; the litigation remains in a pre-trial stage. The KCI Defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in March 2023. Briefing on the motion for summary judgment is complete, but the district court granted a joint motion to vacate the hearing date to allow the parties to discuss a potential resolution of the case. The parties must provide a joint status report by the end of July 2023.\nFor the KCI-related matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded liability at this time.\nCompliance Matter\nThe Company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising from marketing efforts by certain business groups based in China. The Company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws. The Company has retained outside counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the investigation. In July 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating with both agencies. The Company is in discussions related to potential resolution.\nNOTE 15. Business Segments\n3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M’s four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “Corporate and Unallocated”).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2023, the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)) was updated. The change to business segment operating income (loss) aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments. The changes included the items described below. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\nReflecting gains/losses from sale of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated Change\n3M updated its business segment operating performance measure to reflect all gains/losses from sales of PPE and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated. Previously, certain of these gains/losses were included in 3M’s business segments’ operating performance.\nMovement of certain businesses between segments\nThe businesses associated with two groups of products (each with approximately $25 million in sales) were realigned with one moving from the Consumer business segment to the Health Care business segment and the other moving from the Health Care business segment to the Consumer business segment.\nAlso effective in the first quarter of 2023, the Consumer business segment re-aligned from four divisions to the following three divisions: Home, Health and Auto Care; Construction and Home Improvement Markets; and Stationery and Office.\n52\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Segment Information\n(Millions)\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\nNet Sales\n2023\n2022\n2023\nSafety and Industrial\n$\n2,765 $\n2,924 $\n5,544 $\nTransportation and Electronics Health Care\n2,191 2,075\n2,268 2,179\n4,241 4,085\nConsumer\n1,293\n1,330\n2,485\nCorporate and Unallocated\n1\n1\n1\nTotal Company\n$\n8,325 $\n8,702 $\n16,356 $\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\nOperating Performance\n2023\n2022\n2023\nSafety and Industrial\n$\n534 $\n(707) $\n1,135 $\nTransportation and Electronics\n410\n475\n704\nHealth Care\n411\n492\n771\nConsumer\n235\n248\n414\nTotal business segment operating income (loss)\n1,590\n508\n3,024\nCorporate and Unallocated\nCorporate special items:\nNet costs for significant litigation\n(10,357)\n(379)\n(10,439)\nDivestiture costs\n(125)\n—\n(227)\nRussia exit (charges) benefits\n18\n—\n18\nTotal corporate special items\n(10,464)\n(379)\n(10,648)\nOther corporate expense - net\n(84)\n(19)\n(93)\nTotal Corporate and Unallocated\n(10,548)\n(398)\n(10,741)\nTotal Company operating income (loss)\n(8,958)\n110\n(7,717)\nOther expense/(income), net\n65\n50\n117\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(9,023) $\n60 $\n(7,834) $\nCorporate and Unallocated\nCorporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes “corporate special items” and “other corporate expense-net”. Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023—see Note 14), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items also include divestiture costs, gain/loss on business divestitures (see Note 3), divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5), and Russia exit costs/ benefits (see Note 13). Divestiture costs include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, corporate philanthropic activity, gains/losses from sales of PPE and other assets, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from transition supply, manufacturing, and service arrangements with Neogen Corporation following the 2022 split-off of 3M's Food Safety business.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M’s MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n• • • •\nOverview Results of Operations Performance by Business Segment Financial Condition and Liquidity Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results\nThe term \"N/M\" used herein references \"not meaningful\" for certain percent changes.\nForward-looking statements in Part I, Item 2 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results in Part I, Item 2 and the risk factors provided in Part II, Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\nOVERVIEW\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made the following changes:\n\n\nChanges in measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker—impacting 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss))—and realignment of 3M's Consumer business segment from four divisions to three divisions. See additional information in Note 15. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes. See additional information in Note 2. Changes to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n3M has been and may continue to be impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). The Overview section of Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K provides a description of how COVID-19 has impacted or may impact 3M. In addition within this Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023, risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and certain COVID-19 impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Form 10-Q, including in this Item 2.\n3M is also impacted by certain special items such as costs for significant litigation and the sales and income associated with manufactured PFAS products that 3M plans to exit by the end of 2025. During the first six months of 2023, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below) totaled approximately $10.5 billion pre-tax and included, among other things, a $10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the proposed settlement agreement announced in the second quarter of 2023 with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS. See Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items, including references therein to where further information is provided.\nAdditional information regarding certain items impacting pre-2023 periods that may also be relevant in 2023 can be found in the Overview section of Part II, Item 7 as well as in further sections of 3M’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n54\nTable of Contents\nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders – diluted:\nThe following table provides the increases (decreases) in diluted earnings (loss) per share.\nEarnings (loss) per diluted share\nThree months ended June 30, 2023\nSix months ended June 30, 2023\nSame period last year\nNet costs for significant litigation\n$\n0.14 $ 2.34\nManufactured PFAS products\nTotal special items\n(0.03) 2.31\nSame period last year, excluding special items\n$\n2.45 $\nIncrease/(decrease) due to:\nTotal organic growth/productivity and other\n0.06\nRestructuring\n(0.31)\nRaw material impact\n(0.04)\nForeign exchange impacts\n(0.02)\nAcquisitions/divestitures\n(0.03)\nOther expense (income), net Income tax rate\n(0.03) 0.02\nShares of common stock outstanding\n0.07\nCurrent period, excluding special items\n2.17\nNet costs for significant litigation\n(14.43)\nDivestiture costs\n(0.19)\nRussia exit (charges) benefits\n0.04\nManufactured PFAS products\nTotal special items\nCurrent period\n$\n0.06 (14.52) (12.35) $\nThe Company refers to various \"adjusted\" amounts or measures on an “adjusted basis.” These exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below.\nA discussion related to the components of year-on-year changes in earnings (loss) per diluted share follows:\nTotal organic growth/productivity and other:\n\nFor the second quarter of 2023, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings (loss) per diluted share year-on-year:\n◦\nDeclines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year negatively impacted earnings (loss) per share by $0.09. Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year increase of $0.15 per share which was impacted by the following:\n•\nBenefits from ongoing productivity actions, restructuring, strong spending discipline and higher selling prices Lower sales volumes (particularly electronics/consumer retail), inflation impacts and investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability\n\nFor the first six months of 2023, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings (loss) per diluted share year-on-year:\n◦\nDeclines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year and the 2022 exit of operations in Russia negatively impacted earnings (loss) per share by $0.30. Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year decline of $0.02 per share which was impacted by the following:\n▪\n▪\nLower sales volumes (particularly electronics/consumer retail); investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability; manufacturing/supply chain headwinds; inflation impacts; China (COVID-related); and Europe geopolitical impacts Benefits from spending discipline, restructuring, higher selling prices and ongoing productivity actions\n55\n2.40 2.73\n(0.05)\n2.68\n5.08\n(0.32)\n(0.36)\n(0.18)\n(0.12)\n(0.05)\n(0.05) —\n0.14\n4.14\n(14.51)\n(0.34)\n0.04\n0.07 (14.74) (10.60)\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring:\n\n3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of $212 million and $264 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively, compared to no charges and $18 million in the same periods last year, respectively, (refer to Note 5 for additional discussion).\nRaw material impact:\n\n3M continued to experience headwinds year-on-year from the carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation.\nForeign exchange impacts\n\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income (loss) by approximately $39 million (or a decrease of pre-tax earnings (loss) by approximately $23 million) year-on-year for the second quarter of 2023 and decreased operating income (loss) by approximately $115 million (or a decrease of pre-tax earnings (loss) by approximately $99 million) year-on-year for the first six months of 2023, primarily resulting from the strength of the U.S. dollar. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nAcquisitions/divestitures:\n•\n\nAcquisition and divestiture impacts are measured separately for the first 12 months post-transaction. Divestiture impact includes lost income from divested businesses and remaining stranded costs (net of transition arrangement income). In the third quarter of 2022, 3M completed the split-off of the Food Safety business (discussed in Note 3). In the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities (discussed in Note 14). For each of the 12-months post-deconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively.\nOther expense (income), net:\n\n\nLower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense increased expense year-on-year for the second quarter and first six months of 2023. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period year-on-year.\nIncome tax rate:\n\n\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 24.2 percent on a pre-tax loss, compared to (38.3) percent on pre-tax income in the prior year. The primary factor that impacted the comparison of these rates was the second quarter 2022 charge related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (see Note 14). The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was 25.2 percent, compared to 16.8 percent in the prior year. The primary factor that impacted the comparison of the six-month rates was the second quarter 2023 charge related to the proposed settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (discussed in Note 14). On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was 19.1 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points and a decrease of 0.1 percent, respectively, compared to the same period year-on-year.\nShares of common stock outstanding:\n\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings (loss) per share year-on-year for the second quarter and first six months of 2023.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides certain non-GAAP measures. These measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nCertain measures adjust for the impacts of special items. Special items for the periods presented include the items described below. Because 3M provides certain information with respect to business segments, it is noteworthy that special items impacting operating income (loss) are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and manufactured PFAS products items.\nIn 2023, 3M changed certain of its non-GAAP measures by adjusting for the results of manufactured PFAS products in arriving at results, adjusted for special items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a charge for PFAS manufacturing exit costs and included it as an adjustment in arriving at results, adjusted for special items. The 2023 non- GAAP measure change involved expanding the extent of adjustment to include the sales and estimates of income (including exit costs) and associated activity regarding manufactured PFAS products that 3M plans to exit by the end of 2025. The information herein reflects the impacts of these changes for all periods presented.\nThis document contains measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a non-GAAP measure adjusted for special items. These measures and reasons 3M believes they are useful to investors (and, as applicable, used by 3M) include:\nGAAP amounts for which a measure adjusted for special items is also provided: • Net sales (and sales change) • Operating income (loss), segment operating income (loss) and\nReasons 3M believes the measure is useful\noperating income (loss) margin\n• Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate • Net income (loss) • Earnings (loss) per share\nIncome (loss) before taxes\nConsidered, in addition to segment operating performance, in evaluating and managing operations; useful in understanding underlying business performance, provides additional transparency to special items\nSpecial items for the periods presented include:\nNet costs for significant litigation:\n\nThese relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos (which include Aearo and non-Aearo items), PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 14). Net costs include the impacts of changes in accrued liabilities (including interest imputation on contractual settlement obligations), external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with the associated tax impacts. Net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos are reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment while those impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023—see Note 14), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected in corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected as part of special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment.\nDivestiture costs:\n\nThese include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\nManufactured PFAS products:\n\nThese amounts relate to sales and estimates of income regarding manufactured PFAS products that 3M plans to exit by the end of 2025 included within the Transportation and Electronics business segment. Estimated income does not contemplate impacts on non-operating items such as net interest income/expense and the non-service cost components portion of defined benefit plan net periodic benefit costs.\nRussia exit charges/benefits:\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, 3M recorded a gain on final disposal of net assets in Russia. Previously, in the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a charge primarily related to impairment of these assets in connection with management's committed exit and disposal plan.

In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales decreased 16 percent which included decreased organic sales of 11 percent. In Japan, total sales decreased 20 percent which included decreased organic sales of 12 percent.\nManaging currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. Net of the Company’s hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\n61\nWorldwide\n8,325\n100.0 %\n(2.2)\n0.1\n(1.3) (0.9)\n(4.3) %\nWorldwide\n16,356\n100.0 %\n(3.6)\n0.1\n(1.3)\n(1.9)\n(6.7) %\nTable of Contents\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its own stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nCost of sales\n55.3 %\n58.5 %\n(3.2)%\n56.4 %\n56.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\n146.6\n34.7\n111.9\n85.0\n27.9\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\n5.7\n5.5\n0.2\n5.8\n5.5\nOperating income (loss) margin\n(107.6)%\n1.3 %\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n10.0 %\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual grant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which impacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were primarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending discipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in growth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\nChange\n(0.2)%\n57.1\n0.3\n(57.2)%\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A in 2023 was primarily impacted by a $10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the proposed settlement agreement announced in the second quarter of 2023 with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see Note 14). SG&A was also impacted by restructuring charges, divestiture costs (related to separating and preparing the Health Care business for spin-off), continued investment in key growth initiatives and ongoing respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters. These impacts were partially offset by lower net costs for significant litigation to address Combat Arms Earplugs litigation matters (for which a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion was reflected in the second quarter of 2022), restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost management.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations. R&D was also impacted by restructuring charges.\nOther Expense (Income), Net:\nSee Note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.\nInterest expense (net of interest income) decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period year-on-year primarily driven by interest income generated on invested cash.\nThe non-service pension and postretirement net benefit decreased approximately $36 million and $72 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively, compared to the same period year-on-year.\nProvision (benefit) for Income Taxes:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Percent of pre-tax income/loss)\n2023\n2022\n2023\nEffective tax rate\n24.2 %\n(38.3)%\n25.2 %\nThe primary factors that impacted the comparisons of the Company's effective tax rate for the second quarters and the first six months of 2023 and 2022 were the second quarter 2022 charge related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and the second quarter 2023 charge related to the proposed settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (both discussed in Note 14).\nThe tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\nRefer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes.\nIncome from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries, Net of Taxes:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes\n$\n3 $\n(1) $\n5 $\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes, is attributable to the Company’s accounting under the equity method for ownership interests in certain entities such as Kindeva following 3M's divestiture of the drug delivery business in 2020.

In addition, disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Note 15. Effective in the first quarter of 2023, the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income (loss) aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments (see Note 15 for additional details).\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\nCorporate and Unallocated:\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 15. Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes “corporate special items” and “other corporate expense-net”. Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023—see Note 14) costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items also include divestiture costs, gain/loss on business divestitures (see Note 3), divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5), and Russia exit costs/benefits (see Note 13). Divestiture costs include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, corporate philanthropic activity, gains/losses from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense- net also includes costs and income from transition supply, manufacturing and service arrangements with Neogen Corporation following the 2022 split-off of 3M's Food Safety business. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, when compared to the same period last year. The subsections below provide additional information.\nCorporate Special Items\nRefer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items and to Note 15 for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of the $10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the proposed settlement agreement announced in the second quarter of 2023 with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see Note 14) and divestiture costs.\nOther Corporate Expense - Net\nOther corporate operating expenses, net, increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, when compared to the same period last year. The year-on-year increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax restructuring charges (see Note 5).\nOperating Business Segments:\nInformation related to 3M’s business segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables.\nRefer to 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1, Business, for discussion of 3M products that are included in each business segment.\n64\nTable of Contents\nSafety and Industrial Business:\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n2023\n2022\n2023\nSales (millions)\n$\n2,765\n$\n2,924\n$\n5,544\n$\nSales change analysis:\nOrganic sales\n(4.6) %\n(5.3) %\nTranslation\n(0.9)\n(1.9)\nTotal sales change\n(5.5) %\n(7.2) %\nBusiness segment operating income (loss) (millions)\n$\n534\n$\n(707)\n$\n1,135\n$\nPercent change\n(175.6) %\nN/M\nPercent of sales\n19.3 %\n(24.2) %\n20.5 %\nAdjusted business segment operating income (millions) (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n614\n$\n630\n$\n1,176\n$\nPercent change\nPercent of sales\n(2.4) % 22.2 %\n21.5 %\n(10.9) % 21.2 %\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023 —see Note 14), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated--see note 15 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\nSecond quarter 2023 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.5 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n\nSales increased in roofing granules, and automotive aftermarket and decreased in closure and masking systems, personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets. Growth was held back by disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety (which negatively impacted year-on-year second quarter organic growth by 4.8 percentage points); declines in closure and masking systems due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity; and declines within industrial adhesives and tapes from continued end-market softness in electronics.\nBusiness segment operating income (loss) margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 14). In addition, year-on-year margins increased from productivity actions, strong spending discipline, and pricing which more than offset the decline driven by lower sales volume, restructuring costs, and inflation impacts. Adjusting for special items (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n65\n2022\n5,975\n(80)\n(1.3) %\n1,320\n22.1 %\nTable of Contents\nFirst six months 2023 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 7.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n\nSales increased in automotive aftermarket, electrical markets, roofing granules, and abrasives and decreased in personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, and closure and masking systems.

Investing in 3M’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had $1.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2023, compared to no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nTotal debt:\nThe strength of 3M’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit rating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Company’s total debt at June 30, 2023 was consistent when compared to December 31, 2022 as maturities of $1.8 billion of fixed-rate notes were offset by issuances of commercial paper of $1.8 billion. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR’s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023, and certain USD LIBOR rates subject to a synthetic methodology will continue to be published until September 2024. The Company anticipates its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments that previously utilized LIBOR as the reference rate will transition to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as a reference rate as necessary.\nEffective February 8, 2023, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated February 10, 2020. In May 2016, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of June 30, 2023, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 10 of this Form 10-Q and Note 12 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn May 2023, 3M entered into a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028; the facility was amended in July 2023. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The agreement replaced the amended and restated $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement and the $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility that would have expired in November 2024 and November 2023, respectively. The credit facility was undrawn at June 30, 2023. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At June 30, 2023, this ratio, reflecting the July 2023 amendment, was approximately 17 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also had $315 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at June 30, 2023. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\nAt June 30, 2023, 3M had $4.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.2 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.1 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2022, 3M had $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.7 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $1.2 billion was held by the United States. The increase from December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from cash flow from operations.\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n(Millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nTotal debt\n$\n15,987 $\n15,939 $\nLess: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n4,337\n3,916\nNet debt (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n11,650 $\n12,023 $\nRefer to the preceding Total Debt and Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities sections for additional details.\nBalance Sheet:\n3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure):\n(Millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCurrent assets\n$\n15,754 $\n14,688 $\nLess: Current liabilities\n10,936\n9,523\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n4,818 $\n5,165 $\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $0.3 billion compared with December 31, 2022. Balance changes in current assets increased working capital by $1.1 billion, driven largely by increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $1.4 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings driven by issuances of commercial paper and increases in other current liabilities.\n71\nChange\nChange\n48\n421\n(373)\n1,066\n1,413\n(347)\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Millions)\n2023\nNet income (loss) including noncontrolling interest\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n(5,855) $ 915\nCompany pension and postretirement contributions\n(57)\nCompany pension and postretirement expense\n75\nStock-based compensation expense\n176\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes)\n(2,956)\nAccounts receivable\n(393)\nInventories Accounts payable\n101 135\nOther — net\n10,643\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n2,784 $\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\nIn the first six months of 2023, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $646 million compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by the combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. Cumulatively, they decreased operating cash flow by $157 million in the first six months of 2023, compared to operating cash flow decreasing by $893 million for these items in the first six months of 2022. The second quarter pre-tax charges of approximately $10.3 billion in 2023 related to the proposed settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS and $1.2 billion in 2022 related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (both discussed in Note 14) largely impacted the net income component above, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements in each of those periods.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nSix months ended June 30,\n(Millions)\n2023\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\n$\n(852) $\nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets\n23\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n—\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold\n170 3\nOther — net\n37\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n(619) $\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n72\n2022\n2022\n1,385 921\n(80)\n83\n182\n(460)\n(457)\n(837) 401\n1,000\n2,138\n(808)\n56\n—\n(62) 13\n(13)\n(814)\nTable of Contents\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures.

During the first six months of 2023, maturities of $1.8 billion of fixed-rate notes were offset by issuances of commercial paper of $1.8 billion. The Company had $1.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding at June 30, 2023, compared to no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)” in the preceding table. 3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 2022 issuances, maturities, and extinguishments of short-and long-term debt are described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 2. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2023, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $6.00 per share and marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second- quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income (loss) or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income (loss) attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion vary across quarters throughout the year.

The Company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance. Words such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to:\n\n•\n\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •\nworldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, capital markets and other external conditions, such as interest rates, monetary policy, financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, inflation, recession, military conflicts, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers, risks related to unexpected events such as the public health crises associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, liabilities and the outcome of contingencies related to certain fluorochemicals known as \"PFAS,\" as well as matters related to the Company's plans to discontinue the use of PFAS, risks related to the proposed class-action settlement (“Settlement”) to resolve claims by public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS, including whether court approval of the Settlement will be obtained, whether the number of plaintiffs that opt out of the Settlement will exceed current expectations or will exceed the level that would permit 3M to terminate the Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the Settlement if this occurs), whether the Settlement is appealed, the timing and amount of payments made under the Settlement, and the impact of the settlement on other PFAS-related matters, the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market position, competitive conditions and customer preferences, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, new business opportunities, product and service development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products and services, fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, information technology systems including implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, security breaches and other disruptions to information technology infrastructure, the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities, operational execution, including inability to generate productivity improvements and impact of organizational restructuring activities, future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending, future access to credit markets and the cost of credit, pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions, asset impairments, tax liabilities and effects of changes in tax rates, laws or regulations, the proposed spin-off of the Company's Health Care business to establish two separate public companies, the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings initiated by the Company's Aearo Entities, and laws and regulations, as well as legal compliance risks (including third-party risks), and legal and regulatory proceedings related to the same, including with regards to environmental matters and product liability, in the United States and other countries in which we operate.\n75\nTable of Contents\nThe Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,” “Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the context of Item 3, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of sensitivity analysis related to these types of market risks, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in information that would have been provided in the context of Item 3 from the end of the preceding year until June 30, 2023. However, the Company does provide risk management discussion in various places in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, primarily in the Derivatives note.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\na. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nb. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application the Company implements, this application, along with the internal control over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. The Company concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nTable of Contents\n3M COMPANY FORM 10-Q For the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2023 PART II.

Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nRisks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises\nThe Company’s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.\nThe Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Company’s operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, public health emergencies such as COVID-19, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\nThe global economy has been impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022 and completed a sale of the related assets in June 2023. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in Russia and has experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, further supply chain disruptions impacting downstream customers, higher energy costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain.\nClimate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.\n77\nTable of Contents\nUnexpected events, such as those related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health crisis, may increase the Company's cost of doing business and disrupt the Company's operations.\n3M, as a global company, is impacted by unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), civil unrest, natural disasters, and severe weather in the locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate, and these events have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company's operations and financial performance. For example, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, including related evolving governmental responses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3M’s operations, including its supply chain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Although COVID-19 increased demand for certain 3M products, it also resulted in decreased demand from certain end markets, made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers, and resulted in conditions that had the potential to damage 3M's reputation, including third-party price gouging, counterfeiting, and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving 3M's products. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. As the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators has experienced a decline from prior levels. 3M is not able to predict the impact of unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and unexpected events may have a material adverse effect on 3M's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\nBecause the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, see Part I, Item 2, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\nThe Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as “PFAS.” 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may require additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company.\nThe PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS substances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3M. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. The Company continues to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3M’s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n78\nTable of Contents\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M’s decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations. The Company recognized a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with this announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with its exit activities. In addition, these two announced actions (the “exit”) involve risks, including the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the Company’s ability to complete such exit, on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to PFAS manufacturing and production, or the Company’s exit plans; the Company’s ability to identify and manufacture acceptable substitutes for the discontinued products, and the possibility that such substitutes will not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the Company’s exit plans; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, or otherwise have negative impacts on the Company’s relationships with its customers and other counterparties.\n3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a proposed class-action settlement (“Settlement”) to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States regarding any PFAS, subject to court approval. If the court approves the Settlement and all conditions in the Settlement are met, 3M will pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the Settlement, with payments to be made annually from 2024 through 2036, in exchange for a release of certain claims, as described further in Note 14. The Settlement gives 3M the option to terminate the Settlement if the numbers of eligible class members opting out of the Settlement exceed specified levels. Unexpected events related to the Settlement, including whether court approval of the Settlement will be obtained, whether the number of plaintiffs that opt out of the Settlement will exceed current expectations or will exceed the level that would permit 3M to terminate the Settlement (and whether 3M will elect to terminate the Settlement if this occurs), whether the Settlement is appealed, and the impact of the settlement on other PFAS-related matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or its consolidated financial position.\nGovernmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company.\n79\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations. The Company operates globally, including in some jurisdictions that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues, and is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; securities and corporate laws; antitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies; U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company’s suppliers, vendors, or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M’s Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements.\nThe failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations.\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company’s expectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the extent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation exposure, including expenses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company’s reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company’s intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company’s activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company’s reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n80\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\nThe Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\nThe Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\nThis ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\nThe Company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors.\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. In addition, some of our suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such suppliers and the Company's ability to source adequate alternatives in a cost effective manner. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to fulfill supply obligations to its customers. The Company could incur contractual penalties, experience a deterioration in customer relationships, or suffer harm to its reputation if the Company is unable to fulfill its obligations to customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n81\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Company employs information technology systems to support its business and collect, store, and/or use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of its business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the Company’s information technology systems, networks and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the Company’s operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the Company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, reputation, and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state entities, or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity counter measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology systems, networks and infrastructure are still potentially susceptible to attack, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities, or zero day attacks, in our systems or in the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses, malware or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The Company’s increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity counter measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against attacks. While we and third parties we utilize have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks on and breaches and other disruptions of the Company’s and the third parties' information technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such incidents to date have had a material impact on the Company. Any cybersecurity incident or information technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the Company’s operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the Company’s reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nAcquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies could affect future results.\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions and strategic alliances, future results will be affected by, as applicable, the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies and the Company's ability to operationalize and derive anticipated benefits from alliances. Divestitures may include continued involvement in the divested businesses, such as through transitional or longer-term supply or distribution arrangements, following the transaction, and may result in unexpected liabilities through indemnification or other risk-shifting mechanisms in the applicable divestiture agreement. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s future results.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including through organizational restructurings and scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than planned.\nThe Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation, including restructurings from time to time, to streamline its operations, improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. Workforce restructuring activities impact business groups, functions, and geographies, and the structural reorganization is expected to reduce the size of the corporate center, simplify supply chain, streamline 3M's geographic footprint, reduce layers of management, further align business go-to-market models to customers, and reduce manufacturing roles to align with production volumes, with the goal of improving the Company's longer-term outlook in overall performance. There can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits of such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected or negative consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales; a relationship impact with employees; or a reduced ability to provide the experience that our customers, suppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M’s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\nThe Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\nChange in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\nThe Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit rating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. Moody’s Investor Service downgraded the Company’s credit rating from A1 to A2, and S&P Global Ratings downgraded the Company’s credit rating from A to A- (and downgraded the Company’s short-term credit rating from A-2 to A-1), in connection with the Company’s announcement of the Settlement. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\nChanges in tax rates, laws, or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company’s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi- jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\n83\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to the Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings Initiated by the Company’s Aearo Entities\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries’ chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn July 26, 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (\"Aearo Entities\"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust – funded by the Company – to address potential liabilities related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version 2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by Aearo Entities. This represented a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. Aearo Entities were acquired by the Company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries, have operated as Company subsidiaries since that time. 3M has entered into a funding agreement with Aearo Entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation, and to support Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund this trust and an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the funding agreement, 3M would provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities. As discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy proceeding, and the judge certified a direct appeal of the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Aearo has appealed the decision. Following dismissal of the bankruptcy, Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities will proceed in the federal and state multidistrict litigation, and will continue to proceed against 3M, which is a defendants in those litigation matters. 3M has been engaged in active confidential mediation pursuant to the orders of the federal and state MDL courts. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the chapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the Company’s reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and other counterparties and community members; impacts to the Company’s liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of the Company’s obligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with Aearo Entities; the costs of chapter 11 proceedings and length of time necessary to resolve the cases; and Aearo Entities’ ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the chapter 11 proceedings to obtain approval and consummation of a plan of reorganization. In addition, due to the dismissal of the Aearo Entities bankruptcy proceeding, attempts to comprehensibly resolve with finality all Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities and 3M outside of the bankruptcy proceeding and in a litigation settlement involve significant challenges that could cause the Company to incur substantial and material costs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot predict the timing, outcome, or financial impact of this matter, or any other ongoing or future related litigation.\nRisks Related to the Planned Spin-off of the Company’s Health Care Business\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Health Care business.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for the Company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, satisfactory completion of financing, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, and other customary conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, or developments involving the Company or any of its businesses, many of which are outside of the Company’s control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Company’s ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Company’s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties. In addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the Company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Health Care business, or the Company’s stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\n84\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Adjusted EBIT grew modestly in comparable constant currency terms and we returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders. After delivering earnings growth of 8% in the first half, demand softened considerably and customer destocking persisted through the last two quarters of the year.\nWhile we expect current market conditions to continue in the near-term, we have visibility to a number of controllable factors we believe will support a return to solid earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and leave us well placed to grow at our long term trend of high-single digit rates thereafter. We are pricing to compensate for inflation and we expect benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a favorable and sustainable impact on operating leverage. In addition, we expect the headwinds from the sale of our Russian plants and higher interest expense will be largely limited to the first half.\nWe remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and will continue to pursue opportunities to invest in the business, particularly through innovation and sustainability initiatives in faster growing, higher value markets.

On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.\n3\nVolume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets, and a mid single digit decline in Latin America. The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as well as customer destocking. In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBIT of $387 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation.

Hot fill beverage container volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.\nIn Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the region.\nAdjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 4% lower than last year reflecting approximately 6% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 2%.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 8% lower than the same quarter last year as a result of lower consumer demand and customer destocking more than offsetting new business wins. June 2023 quarter hot fill beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.\nAdjusted EBIT of $73 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nNet interest and income tax expense\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period last year, reflecting higher interest rates. GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last year. Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year. Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items in both periods.\n4\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year. The year over year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives. June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.\nNet debt was $6,057 million at June 30, 2023. Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations.\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nFor the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects:\n\nAdjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:\n\nComparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single digit % to up low single digit %, a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, and a negative impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;\n\nA negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of the Company's three plants in Russia on December 23, 2022; and\n\nA benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the balance of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the mid-teens % compared with the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and the residual headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal 2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023, benefiting in-part from structural cost saving initiatives and increased earnings leverage resulting from price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal 2023.\n\nApproximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\nAmcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a degree of uncertainty and additional complexity when estimating future financial results.

Such statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Amcor and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties. None of Amcor or any of its respective directors, executive officers, or advisors provide any representation, assurance, or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements; the loss of key customers, a reduction in production requirements of key customers; significant competition in the industries and regions in which Amcor operates; failure by Amcor to expand its business; challenging current and future global economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflation; impact of operating internationally; price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy, and other inputs; disruptions to production, supply, and commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility; pandemics, epidemics, or other disease outbreaks; an inability to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled workforce; costs and liabilities related to environment, health, and safety (\"EHS\") laws and regulations as well as changes in the global climate; labor disputes and an inability to renew collective bargaining agreements at acceptable terms; risks related to climate change; cybersecurity risks; failures or disruptions in information technology systems; rising interest rates; a significant increase in indebtedness or a downgrade in the credit rating; foreign exchange rate risk; a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets; failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; inability of Amcor's insurance policies to provide adequate protections; challenges to or the loss of intellectual property rights; litigation, including product liability claims or regulatory developments; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to Amcor's Environmental, Social and Governance practices and commitments resulting in increased costs; changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters; changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings; and other risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in Amcor’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including without limitation, those described under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of Amcor’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can obtain copies of Amcor’s filings with the SEC for free at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nPresentation of non-GAAP information\nIncluded in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. In arriving at these non- GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include:\n\n• • • • • • • • • •\nmaterial restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans; material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries; changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper; significant pension settlements; impairments in goodwill and equity method investments; material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs; material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory; amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination; gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery; certain regulatory and legal matters; impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nAmcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.\nManagement has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company’s reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort. These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period.\nDividends\nAmcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its ordinary share and CDI registers from September 6, 2023 to September 7, 2023 inclusive.\n7\nU.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ million, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2023\nNet sales\n3,909\n3,673\nCost of

The Company's strong annual cash flow and balance sheet provide substantial capacity to reinvest in the business for organic growth, pursue acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend as well as regular share repurchases.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases in addition to completing three bolt-on acquisitions.\nDividend\nThe Amcor Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12.25 cents per share (compared with 12.0 cents per share in the same quarter last year). Combined with the last three quarterly dividends, this increases the annual dividend for fiscal 2023 to 49.0 cents per share. The quarterly dividend declared today will be paid in US dollars to holders of Amcor’s ordinary shares trading on the NYSE. Holders of CDIs trading on the ASX will receive an unfranked dividend of 18.77 Australian cents per share, which reflects the quarterly dividend of 12.25 cents per share converted at an average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.6526 over the five trading days ended August 14, 2023.\nThe ex-dividend date will be September 6, 2023, the record date will be September 7, 2023, and the payment date will be September 27, 2023.\nShare repurchases\nAmcor repurchased approximately 41 million shares (approximately 3% of total shares issued and outstanding) during fiscal 2023 for a total cost of $431 million.\nAmcor expects to allocate approximately $70 million of cash towards share repurchases in fiscal 2024, as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\n2023 financial results\nSegment Information\nTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2022\nTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2023\nAdjusted non-GAAP results\nNet sales $ million\nEBIT $ million\nEBIT / Sales %\nEBIT / Average funds employed %(1)\nNet sales $ million\nEBIT $ million\nEBIT / Sales %\nEBIT / Average funds employed %(1)\nFlexibles\n11,151\n1,517\n13.6\n11,154\n1,429\n12.8\nRigid Packaging\n3,393\n289\n8.5\n3,540\n265\n7.5\nOther(2)\n—\n(105)\n—\n(86)\nTotal Amcor\n14,544\n1,701\n11.7\n16.3\n14,694\n1,608\n10.9\n15.4\n(1) Return on average funds employed includes shareholders' equity and net debt, calculated using a four quarter average and Last Twelve Months adjusted EBIT.

On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 1% higher than last year reflecting price/mix benefits of 4%, partly offset by approximately 3% lower volumes.\nIn North America, net sales were marginally lower than the prior year driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/ mix benefits. Volumes were higher in the healthcare, pet care, cheese, and home and personal care categories, and this was more than offset by lower volumes in categories including condiments, meat, and ready meals.\nIn Europe, net sales grew in the low single digit range driven by price/mix benefits, partly offset by lower volumes. Volumes were lower in the coffee, home and personal care, yogurt and confectionary categories. This was partly offset by higher volumes in the pet care and pharmaceutical categories.\nNet sales were in line with the prior year across the Asia Pacific region, with price/mix benefits offset by lower volumes. Volumes were lower in China where demand was unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related lockdowns. Sales growth remained strong in India, Australia, and the pan-Asian healthcare and meat end markets. In Latin America, net sales declined in the low single digit range driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits.\nAdjusted EBIT of $1,429 million was 1% higher than in the prior period on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting favorable operating cost performance, partly offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 12.8% includes an adverse impact of approximately 100 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $2,777 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis, including a favorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% related to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $25 million (representing 1% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.\n3\nVolume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets, and a mid single digit decline in Latin America. The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as well as customer destocking. In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBIT of $387 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nRigid Packaging\nTwelve Months Ended June 30,\n2022 $ million\n2023 $ million\nReported ∆%\nComparable constant currency ∆%\nNet sales\n3,393\n3,540\n4\n(3)\nAdjusted EBIT\n289\n265\n(8)\n(7)\nAdjusted EBIT / Sales %\n8.5\n7.5\nTwelve months ended June 30, 2023\nNet sales of $3,540 million were 4% higher than last year on a reported basis, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and price increases of approximately $260 million (representing 8% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by approximately 4% lower volumes.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.\nIn Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the region.\nAdjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 4% lower than last year reflecting approximately 6% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 2%.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 8% lower than the same quarter last year as a result of lower consumer demand and customer destocking more than offsetting new business wins. June 2023 quarter hot fill beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.\nAdjusted EBIT of $73 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nNet interest and income tax expense\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period last year, reflecting higher interest rates. GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last year. Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year. Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items in both periods.\n4\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year. The year over year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives. June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.\nNet debt was $6,057 million at June 30, 2023. Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations.\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nFor the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects:\n\nAdjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:\n\nComparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single digit % to up low single digit %, a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, and a negative impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;\n\nA negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of the Company's three plants in Russia on December 23, 2022; and\n\nA benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the balance of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the mid-teens % compared with the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and the residual headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal 2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023, benefiting in-part from structural cost saving initiatives and increased earnings leverage resulting from price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal 2023.\n\nApproximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\nAmcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a degree of uncertainty and additional complexity when estimating future financial results. Further information can be found under 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' in this release.\nConference Call\nAmcor is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss these results on Wednesday August 16, 2023 at 5:30pm US Eastern Daylight Time / Thursday August 17, 2023 at 7:30am Australian Eastern Standard Time.

Forward-looking statements are generally identified with words like “believe,” “expect,” “target,” “project,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “approximately,” “possible,” “will,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” \"commit,\" “estimate,” “potential,” \"ambitions,\" “outlook,” or “continue,” the negative of these words, other terms of similar meaning, or the use of future dates. Such statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Amcor and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties. None of Amcor or any of its respective directors, executive officers, or advisors provide any representation, assurance, or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements; the loss of key customers, a reduction in production requirements of key customers; significant competition in the industries and regions in which Amcor operates; failure by Amcor to expand its business; challenging current and future global economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflation; impact of operating internationally; price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy, and other inputs; disruptions to production, supply, and commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility; pandemics, epidemics, or other disease outbreaks; an inability to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled workforce; costs and liabilities related to environment, health, and safety (\"EHS\") laws and regulations as well as changes in the global climate; labor disputes and an inability to renew collective bargaining agreements at acceptable terms; risks related to climate change; cybersecurity risks; failures or disruptions in information technology systems; rising interest rates; a significant increase in indebtedness or a downgrade in the credit rating; foreign exchange rate risk; a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets; failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; inability of Amcor's insurance policies to provide adequate protections; challenges to or the loss of intellectual property rights; litigation, including product liability claims or regulatory developments; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to Amcor's Environmental, Social and Governance practices and commitments resulting in increased costs; changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters; changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings; and other risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in Amcor’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including without limitation, those described under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of Amcor’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can obtain copies of Amcor’s filings with the SEC for free at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nPresentation of non-GAAP information\nIncluded in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. In arriving at these non- GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include:\n\n• • • • • • • • • •\nmaterial restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans; material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries; changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper; significant pension settlements; impairments in goodwill and equity method investments; material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs; material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory; amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination; gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery; certain regulatory and legal matters; impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nAmcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.\nManagement has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company’s reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort. These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period.\nDividends\nAmcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its ordinary share and CDI registers from September 6, 2023 to September 7, 2023 inclusive.\n7\nU.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ million, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2023\nNet sales\n3,909\n3,673\nCost of

BUSINESS\nOverview\nAmerican Express is a globally integrated payments company, providing customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. We are a leader in providing credit and charge cards to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. American Express cards issued by us, as well as by third-party banks and other institutions on the American Express network, can be used by Card Members to charge purchases at the millions of merchants around the world that accept cards bearing our logo.\n®\nOur various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams and direct response advertising.\nWe were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association and were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal operating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve).\nWe principally engage in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other. Our businesses function together to form our end-to-end integrated payments platform, which we believe is a differentiator that underpins our business model. For further information about our reportable operating segments, please see “Business Segment Results of Operations” under “MD&A.”\nOur Integrated Payments Platform\nThrough our general-purpose card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses, we are able to connect participants and provide differentiated value across the commerce path. We maintain direct relationships with both our Card Members (as a card issuer) and merchants (as an acquirer), and we handle all key aspects of those relationships. These relationships create a “closed loop” in that we have direct access to information at both ends of the card transaction, which distinguishes our integrated payments platform from the bankcard networks.\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to analyze information on Card Member spending and build algorithms and other analytical tools that we use to underwrite risk, reduce fraud and provide targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and partners and special offers and services to Card Members, all while respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements. Through contractual relationships, we also obtain information from third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we do business.\nCard Issuing Businesses\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses are conducted through our USCS, CS and ICS reportable operating segments. We offer a broad set of card products, rewards and services to a diverse consumer and commercial customer base, in the United States and internationally. We acquire and retain high- spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by:\n\nDesigning innovative products and features that appeal to our target customer base and meet their spending and borrowing needs\n\nUsing incentives to drive spending on our various card products and increase customer engagement, including our Membership Rewards program, cash-back reward features, interest rates offered on deposits and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners\n\nProviding digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as airport lounge access, dining experiences and other travel and lifestyle benefits\n\nCreating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care\n\nDeveloping a wide range of partner relationships, including with other corporations and institutions that sponsor certain of our cards under cobrand arrangements and provide benefits and services to our Card Members\nOver the last several years, we have focused on broadening the appeal of our products to attract new customers, particularly Millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our position with small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. We have also introduced new adjacent products that complement our existing products, such as our business checking and consumer rewards checking account products and new digital capabilities, which in part result from our acquisitions of Kabbage, Resy and acompay. Additionally, we have evolved our card issuing businesses by bringing together our consumer, SME and large commercial issuing activities outside of the United States into a new ICS organization to enable a greater focus on local priorities. Jurisdictions that represent a significant portion of our billed business outside of the United States include the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), Australia, Japan, Canada and Mexico.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,338 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 76.7 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide.\nMerchant Acquiring Business\nOur GMNS reportable operating segment builds and manages relationships with millions of merchants around the world that choose to accept American Express cards. This includes signing new merchants to accept our cards, agreeing on the discount rate (a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards) and handling servicing for merchants. We also build and maintain relationships with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage aspects of our merchant services business. For example, through our OptBlue merchant-acquiring program, third-party acquirers contract directly with small merchants for card acceptance on our network and determine merchant pricing. We continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world and work with merchant partners so that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their American Express cards are accepted. We also seek to drive greater usage of the American Express network by deepening merchant engagement and increasing Card Member awareness through initiatives such as our Shop Small campaigns and deploying new payment options such as debit and B2B capabilities.\n®\nGMNS also provides fraud-prevention tools, marketing solutions, data analytics and other programs and services to merchants and other partners that leverage the capabilities of our integrated payments platform.\n2\n®\nTable of Contents\nCard Network Business\nWe operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 103 countries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $214.5 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 56.5 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide.\nDiverse Customer Base and Global Footprint\nOur broad and diverse customer base spans consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. The following chart provides a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint based on worldwide network volumes:\n3\nTable of Contents\nPartners and Relationships\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform.\nThere are many examples of how we connect partners with our integrated payments platform, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g., Delta Air Lines (Delta), Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide Holdings and British Airways); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay with Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers (e.g., OptBlue partners); operating through joint ventures in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in China, the Middle East and Switzerland); developing new capabilities and features with our digital partners (e.g., PayPal and i2c); integrating into the supplier payment processes of our business customers (e.g., BILL, BillTrust and Versapay); and extending the platform into travel services with American Express leisure and business travel (e.g., Fine Hotels and Resorts). We also have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (GBTG), which provides business travel-related services.\nDelta is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and expenses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio represented approximately 10 percent of worldwide network volumes and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer.\nWorking with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base.\nOur Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix\nOur “spend-centric” business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards.\nWe believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners.\nThe American Express Brand and Service Excellence\nOur brand and its attributes—trust, security and service—are key assets. We invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting our brand, including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise. The American Express brand is ranked among the most valuable brands in the world. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world.\nWe aim to provide the world’s best customer experience every day and our reputation for world-class service has been recognized by numerous awards over the years. Our customer care professionals, travel consultants and partners treat servicing interactions as an opportunity to bring the brand to life for our customers, add meaningful value and deepen relationships.\n4\nTable of Contents\nOur Business Strategies\nWe seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives:\nFirst, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers’ everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers.\nSecond, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers.\nThird, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services.\nFinally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives.\nWe previously had as a strategic imperative to make American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives, which we believe has become embedded in our company and is inherent in the work we do in furtherance of our strategic imperatives.\nWe also have an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy that focuses on three pillars. The Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) pillar supports a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, marketplace and society. The Advancing Climate Solutions pillar focuses on enhancing our operations and capabilities to meet customer and community needs in the transition to a low-carbon future. Finally, the Building Financial Confidence pillar seeks to provide responsible, secure and transparent products and services to help people and businesses build financial resilience.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOur Colleagues\nWe are focused on our culture built on supportive relationships and an inclusive workplace, where colleagues can feel welcome and heard, and are provided with opportunities to grow and thrive. As a result, we believe our colleagues are more engaged, committed, creative and effective in driving results. At the heart of our culture is what we call our Blue Box Values – a set of guiding principles that serve as the foundation for how we operate: We Do What's Right We Back Our Customers We Make It Great We Respect People\nWe Embrace Diversity We Stand for Equity and Inclusion We Win as A Team We Support Communities\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 77,300 people, whom we refer to as colleagues, with approximately 26,000 colleagues in the United States and approximately 51,300 colleagues outside the United States. We added colleagues in 2022 to support our strong business growth. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to offer a compelling value proposition to our colleagues, including competitive compensation and leading benefits. We continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross-border and cross-business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. The health and wellness of our colleagues continue to be priorities for us and we take a holistic approach to well-being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both. This approach is designed to enable us to both broaden the talent pool from which we can attract candidates and increase colleague retention.\nWe conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics).\nWe regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States.\n6\nTable of Contents\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below, in alphabetical order, is a list of our executive officers as of February 10, 2023, including each executive officer’s principal occupation and employment during the past five years and reflecting recent organizational changes.

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to digital payments.\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\nThe features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n\nReputation and brand recognition\n\nThe number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n\nThe quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n\nThe attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n\nThe number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n\nThe success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n\nThe speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies and product and service offerings\n\nThe nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n\nThe security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment facilitators and aggregators, digital payment, open banking and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed- loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see “Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry” in “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business, and “Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” and “Legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand” in “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products.\n10\nTable of Contents\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nOverview\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment.\nGovernmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\nPolicymakers around the world continue to propose and adopt new laws and regulations governing a wide variety of issues that may impact our business or change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks, resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes.\nSee “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks” for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBanking Regulation\nFederal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company, TRS and our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB). For purposes of this Supervision and Regulation section, the “Company” refers only to American Express Company, a bank holding company, and does not include its subsidiaries. Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures, any of which could compromise our competitive position. Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and by non-U.S. government agencies and regulatory bodies.\nActivities\nThe BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, we must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and AENB must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of\n11\nTable of Contents\nactivities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that regulatory authorities deem unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly) and regulatory authorities have discretion in determining whether new or modified activities can be conducted in a safe and sound manner.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nApplicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators. In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and, in some cases, subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval.\nFinancial Regulatory Reform\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under these rules, each bank holding company, as well as its bank subsidiaries, is assigned to one of four categories based on its status as a U.S. global systemically important banking organization and five other risk-based indicators: (i) total assets, (ii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iii) non-bank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) weighted short-term wholesale funding.\nUnder these rules, the Company (and its depository institution subsidiary, AENB) is subject to Category IV standards.\nBecause a firm’s categorization is determined by, and can change over time dependent upon, how the firm measures against the risk-based indicator thresholds, we are required to monitor and periodically report these risk-based indicators and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be a Category IV firm in the future.\nCapital and Liquidity Regulation\nCapital Rules\nThe Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators. These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given their level of assets and off- balance sheet obligations. The federal banking regulators’ current capital rules (the Capital Rules) implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (the Basel Committee) framework for strengthening international capital regulation, known as Basel III. For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.”\nUnder the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy ratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. As a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that, among other things, revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements. In September 2022, federal banking regulators announced that they are reaffirming their commitment to implement enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the standards issued by the Basel Committee in December 2017 and that they are developing a joint proposed rule for issuance. If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and applicable to us, the new standards are likely to result in higher capital requirements for us.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments, which became effective January 1, 2020. In August 2020, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years, followed by the three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning in January 1, 2022. We elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by the three-year phase-in period. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has phased in 50 percent of such amount. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” under “MD&A” for additional information on CECL.\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company’s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in June 2021. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations whose ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities, and executive compensation. A bank holding company’s SCB requirement is effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below.\nWe are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent.\nLiquidity Regulation\nThe Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements. The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios, and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that measures a firm’s high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows. Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific LCR requirement.\nA second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), requires a minimum amount of longer- term funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities. Under the NSFR rule, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific NSFR requirement.\nStress Testing and Capital Planning\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s regulations, the Company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions. As part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm.\nAs a Category IV firm, the Company is required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year and was most recently subject to the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests in 2022. The Company is required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan on or before April 5 of each year.\n13\nTable of Contents\nFor Category IV firms, such as the Company, the portion of the SCB based on the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests is calculated every other year. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm receives an updated SCB that reflects the firm's updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV firm can elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in an “off year” and consequently receive an updated SCB.\nWe may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition. If we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument.\nDividends and Other Capital Distributions\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company’s insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy.\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company's regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan.\nIn general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC’s approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC- insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits.\n14\nTable of Contents\nResolution Planning\nCertain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. However, Category IV firms, such as the Company, are not required to submit a holding company resolution plan.\nAENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure. Under the FDIC's rule and its accompanying June 2021 statement on resolution plans for insured depository institutions, insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, such as AENB, are required to submit resolution plans on a three-year cycle. AENB submitted its most recent resolution plan in December 2022, as required.\nOrderly Liquidation Authority\nThe Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution, if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. As under the FDIC resolution model, under the OLA, the FDIC has broad power as receiver. Substantial differences exist, however, between the OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity.\nThe FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA, referred to as the “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a “bridge” holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure.\nFDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB\nIf the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB, the FDIC has the power to: (1) transfer any of AENB’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENB’s creditors; (2) enforce the terms of AENB’s contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB. In addition, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB, including claims of debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB. As a result, regardless of whether the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB, the debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in the U.S. offices of AENB.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOther Banking Regulations\nSource of Strength\nThe Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB. Such support may be required at times when, absent this requirement, the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it. Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nTransactions Between AENB and its Affiliates\nCertain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from AENB) between AENB and its affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their other subsidiaries) are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arm’s-length basis.\nFDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments\nAENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB. The FDIC’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, including AENB, which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nAENB is subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. In May 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking proposing revisions to the CRA regulations, including with respect to the delineation of assessment areas, the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics, the definition of community development activities and data collection and reporting.\nClimate Risk Management\nThe U.S. banking agencies have recently increased their focus on climate risk-related supervision. For example, on December 16, 2021, the OCC issued for public comment a set of proposed “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.” The principles would apply to OCC-regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, like AENB, and are broadly designed to provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks consistent with existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles outline six key aspects of climate-related financial risk management: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. In addition, the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climate-related financial risks in various traditional risk categories. On March 30, 2022 and December 2, 2022, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, respectively, also issued for public comment substantially similar sets of draft principles targeted at financial institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $100 billion subject to their respective supervision, including, with respect to the Federal Reserve, the Company. It is too early to determine what regulations and policies may be adopted or apply to the Company and AENB and the effect of any such regulations or policies on the Company and AENB.\n16\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Financial Products Regulation\nOur consumer-oriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the United States and internationally. In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products, and authority to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nOn February 1, 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered, by regulation, to be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments. The proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe harbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above 25 percent of the consumer's required minimum payment. The rule proposal, if adopted, is not expected to become effective before 2024.\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the “money transmitter” or “sale of check” laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services.\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Regulators’ expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm’s systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.\nPayments Regulation\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems.\nThe EU, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. See “Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” under “Risk Factors.”\n17\nTable of Contents\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Effective October 6, 2022, merchants in Canada (other than in Quebec) are now permitted to surcharge credit card purchases up to a maximum of 2.4 percent as a result of a litigation settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See “Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors.”\nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. In 2021, it imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp. from engaging in certain card issuing activities in India, which were lifted in August 2022 following significant investment in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with the regulation. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network.\nPrivacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security\nRegulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established, and continue to maintain, policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth.\nOur regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection, data governance and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access. Regulators are also focused on data management, resiliency and business continuity, and third-party risk management policies and practices.\nIn the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy, disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process. We have also expanded privacy rights to California residents who are not covered by GLBA, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. Various regulators, U.S. states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws, rules and regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information and cyber security that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements.\nWe are also subject to certain privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate (including countries in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom), some of which are more stringent and/or expansive than those in the United States and some of which may conflict with each other. Some countries and the EU have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions. Other countries may require in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of data. Compliance with such laws results in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us, could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closed-loop data, and could require use of local technology services. Some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property. Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency, business continuity and third-party risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn Europe, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). The GDPR includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities. The UK GDPR mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the GDPR. In October 2022, an Executive Order was signed that, together with regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, would implement a new data privacy framework for cross border transfers of EU personal data to the United States.\nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism\nWe are subject to a significant number of AML/CFT laws and regulations globally.\nIn the United States, the majority of AML/CFT requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time.\nIn Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia, have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML/CFT legislation and regulations applicable to American Express.\nAmong other things, these laws and regulations require us to establish AML/CFT programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions.\nEconomic Sanctions\nNational governments and international bodies, such as the United Nations and the EU, have imposed economic sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels, governments and countries that endanger their interests or violate international norms of behavior. Sanctions have been used to advance a range of foreign policy goals, including conflict resolution, counterterrorism, counternarcotics and promotion of democracy and human rights, among other national and international interests. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as “Specially Designated Nationals,” such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, without a license or other authorization. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to a targeted individual, entity, vessel, government or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity, vessel, government or country has an interest, and prohibit transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons) to such individual, entity, vessel, government or country. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.\nWe maintain a global sanctions compliance program designed to meet the requirements of applicable sanctions regimes.\nAnti-Corruption\nWe are subject to complex anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure by us or our colleagues, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties.\nCompensation Practices\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The federal banking regulators’ guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In 2016, the federal banking regulators, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration proposed revised rules on incentive-based compensation practices, which have not yet been finalized. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues, which could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key colleagues.\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a new rule directing national securities exchanges to require policies mandating, in the case of a restatement of previously issued financial statements, the recovery of excess incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by any such restatement.\n20\nTable of Contents\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website at http://ir.americanexpress.com. We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nIn addition, we routinely post financial and other information, some of which could be material to investors, on our Investor Relations website. Information regarding our corporate sustainability initiatives, including our Environmental, Social and Governance reports, are available on the Corporate Sustainability section of our website at http://about.americanexpress.com/corporate-sustainability.\nThe content of any of our websites referred to in this report is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. We have included such website addresses only as inactive textual references and do not intend them to be active links.\nYou can find certain statistical disclosures required of bank holding companies starting on page A-1, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nOur business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although network volumes tend to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result, the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter. The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retail-related billed business.\n21\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as “Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks,” “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks” and “Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks.” You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Risk Management” section under “MD&A,” which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, and demand for fee-based products and services.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, household income and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine), public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, interest rates, taxes, inflation and deflation (including the effects of related governmental responses), energy costs, availability of capital and credit and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Recently, levels of inflation have been significantly elevated. Sustained periods of high inflation may, among other things, increase certain of our expenses and erode consumer purchasing power, confidence and spending. An economic downturn or recession may result in higher unemployment and lower household income, consumer spending, corporate earnings and business investment, which may negatively impact spending on our cards and demand for our products, and increase delinquencies and write-off rates.\nTravel and entertainment (T&E) expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, for example, are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small business and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 45 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies, unemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact customer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation or unavailability of systems or technology by cyberattacks), operational incidents, and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, including actions aimed at upending geopolitical stability, fiscal and monetary policies (including developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling), trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on travel and mobility and health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel protection products we offer.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had, and continues to have, widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and consumer and business spending. The pandemic and resulting containment measures adversely impacted a significant portion of our network volumes. The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of factors, including the emergence of new variants, impacts to the labor market, supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the impacts of the pandemic may continue even as the pandemic subsides. The extent to which our business and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the lingering impacts of the pandemic will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, including the continued spread and severity of the virus and new variants; the imposition or concern relating to the possible imposition of further containment measures; the availability, distribution, use and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact on consumers and businesses as forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to operational changes and staffing issues; and the extent of the continued resumption of normal operating conditions and customer behaviors.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we suspended all business operations in Russia and Belarus and this conflict has led to economic uncertainty and market disruptions, including heightened energy prices, and the imposition of financial and economic sanctions and export controls designed to constrain Russia. The broader consequences of this conflict remain uncertain, but may include further sanctions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, increased prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, potential retaliatory action by customers or the Russian government against companies such as us, heightened regulatory scrutiny related to sanctions compliance, increased inflation, further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, decreases in global travel, further disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of certain natural resources and other adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions.\nHurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and the impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather- related events. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of U.S. consumer and small business billed business and Card Member loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on purchase volume. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks) and perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards.\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. Government actions or initiatives may also provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages and may create new competitors, including in some cases a government entity. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending and borrowing habits as effectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we evolve our value propositions, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers, such as point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions.\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data and demand for our products and services may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights and by certain regulations, such as open banking initiatives, which may result in disintermediating existing financial services providers, steering customers away from our products and services or decreasing our attractiveness to partners.\nTo the extent we expand into, or further grow in, new business areas and new geographic regions, such as mainland China, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions.\n23\nTable of Contents\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See “Partners and Relationships” under “Business” for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion and Platinum Card Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See “Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n®\n®\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as\n24\nTable of Contents\ncobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners. Similarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cyber security incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our network volumes, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. At December 31, 2022, our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchases that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $31.1 billion. This amount assumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such purchases or to accept such chargebacks, and that all such billed business results in claims-in-full by Card Members. Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the current global economic, financial and geopolitical conditions. See Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding this exposure.\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see “Risk Management—Institutional Credit Risk—Exposure to the Airline and Travel Industry” under “MD&A.”\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers and aggregators are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants on our behalf. As merchants become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing a merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our network volumes, ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\nOur average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and network and loan volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases and, as a result of a litigation settlement, surcharging of credit card purchases is permitted by merchants in certain jurisdictions in Canada. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, which could become more prevalent with the existence of debit cards on the American Express network. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’ expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in- force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct—could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and\n26\nTable of Contents\nmaintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\nWe publicly share certain information about our ESG initiatives. We may face increased scrutiny related to these activities from governments, regulators, the media, investors, colleagues, customers and other stakeholders, including from parties that oppose ESG initiatives. Responding to ESG considerations and the implementation of our ESG goals and initiatives involves risk and uncertainties, requires investments and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our ESG goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results. Our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, if at all, could impact our reputation, colleague retention and public perceptions of our business.\nA major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services.\nWe and third parties collect, process, transfer, host, store, analyze, retain, provide access to and dispose of account information, payment transaction information, and certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues in connection with our cards and other products and in the normal course of our business.\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. These threats can arise from external parties, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems and supply chains, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. Cyber threats, including attacks from state sponsored or nation-state actors, can increase during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card Member, travel and loyalty program data, colleague information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties. We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change, new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. In addition, we maintain cyber crisis response procedures and regularly test our procedures to remain prepared and reduce the risk of harm to our business operations, customers and third parties in the event of an information or cyber security incident.\nDespite our efforts and the efforts of third parties that process, transmit or store our data and data of our customers and colleagues or support our operations, such as service providers, merchants and regulators, the possibility of information, operational and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is\n27\nTable of Contents\ndeployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices and communications platforms that are outside of our network and control environments. For example, we are aware that certain of our third-party vendors have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances affecting our data or the services they provide to us. In addition, new products and services, such as checking accounts and non-card lending, may lead to an increase in the number or types of cyber attacks and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information). An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. Our ability to address incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies.\nInformation, operational or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediation costs), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems and those of our third parties upon which we rely, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience service disruptions or degradation, which may result from technology malfunction, sudden increases in processing or other volumes, natural disasters and weather events, fires, accidents, technology change management issues, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and other cyberattacks, inadequate infrastructure in lesser- developed markets, technology capacity management issues, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or electronic break- ins, or similar events. Service disruptions or degradations can prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, impede or prevent transaction processing and financial reporting, disrupt ordinary business operations, result in contractual penalties or obligations, trigger regulatory reporting obligations, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight, and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cyber security and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch vendors or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that was not authorized or diminishes the value of our closed loop.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe management and oversight of multiple third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over third parties, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers' service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, in certain cases there may be limited alternatives or high costs for diversification, and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to the service providers of our third-party providers.\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement, and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing technology.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services. Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risks related to flaws in our algorithms and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis such technologies produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability and brand or reputational harm.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write- downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nJoint ventures, including our joint venture in China, and minority investments in companies such as GBTG inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment, including as a result of being subject to different laws or regulations. Joint ventures and other partnerships or minority investments operating in foreign jurisdictions may also face risks from adverse regulatory actions, which could adversely affect their operations or our investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and we have been and may in the future be involved in litigation with our joint venture partners and other shareholders and parties related to the joint ventures and investments. During the second quarter of 2022, GBTG became a publicly traded company following the completion of a business combination between American Express Global Business Travel and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. We have extensive commercial arrangements with GBTG, including, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBTG uses the American Express\n29\nTable of Contents\nbrand, GBTG's support of our partnerships, GBTG negotiations with travel suppliers on our behalf and a strategic relationship between GBTG and our Commercial Services business. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of a joint venture partner, other shareholders or management of our joint ventures and companies in which we have minority investments may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. In addition, trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control. The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. We may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past, impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended or terminated in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers’ experience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation.\nOur success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect, the resilience of our colleagues through changes in the working environment, and upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon our personnel not only for business success, but also to act with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our colleagues behave in a manner that does not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our colleagues have had to adapt to rapidly changing conditions during the pandemic and the related return to office arrangements, and if we are unable to continue addressing the safety, health and productivity of our colleagues, as well as their expectations regarding workplace flexibility, our business could suffer. The changing nature of the office environment, such as return to office arrangements and the prevalence of remote and hybrid working, may result in increased costs and present operational and workplace culture challenges that may also adversely affect our business.\nThe market for qualified individuals with diverse perspectives and reflecting the diversity of our communities is highly competitive, with elevated levels of turnover in recent years, and we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals. We have and may continue to experience increased costs related to compensation and other benefits necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture.\nOur operations, business, customers and partners could be materially adversely affected by climate change.\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers’ spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact our business, our customers and partners. We and other parties in our value chain are expected to be subject to additional climate and other environmental-related obligations arising from legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad. For example, banking regulators and other governmental authorities and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions, and several of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued proposals for principles designed to provide a framework for the management of climate-related risks. Disclosure of additional climate-related information by companies has also begun to be mandated by legislation and regulators, even as the availability and quality of such information remains limited. We could also be required to change our business and management practices and experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation and changes to our technology, operations, products and services, as well as reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response to climate change and our efforts relating to the Advancing Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy. Our risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, measuring and controlling our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of climate change may not be predictable.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect our relationships\n30\nTable of Contents\nwith Card Members, partners, merchants, service providers and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase our costs of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\nIn preparation for the completion of Brexit, numerous EU laws and regulations were separately adopted into UK domestic legislation in order to ensure continuity. However, the UK plans to evaluate the extent to which these EU-legacy laws and regulations should change going forward and has already indicated some areas where it may take a different approach from the EU. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts, as well as potential regulatory enforcement actions and penalties.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital.\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In a ruling issued on February 7, 2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. As a result, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU.\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act and the AMLA, with regard to maintaining effective AML/CFT programs. Similar AML/CFT requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. As regulators increase their focus in this area, new technologies such as digital currencies develop and we introduce new products like checking accounts, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards. Any new requirements may restrict our ability to issue cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect our revenue growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business.\nAt any given time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of possible regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other\n31\nTable of Contents\nlegal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. For example, as previously disclosed, in May 2020, we began responding to a review by the OCC and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January 2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against us at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against us seeking fines or other remedial actions. We are cooperating with all inquiries. We continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally, take disciplinary and remedial actions where appropriate, and provide information regarding our reviews to our regulators, including the Federal Reserve.\nWe also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions, such as a renewed focus on fair lending laws, and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, and in connection with our ESG-related disclosures and initiatives.\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and Mastercard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions. Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For example, if the 2017 Basel Committee revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements are adopted in the United States and applicable to us, we are likely to be required to hold significantly more capital. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on results from a supervisory stress test.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our U.S. bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock.\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Stress Testing and Capital Planning” and “Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under “Supervision and Regulation,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity—Dividends and Share Repurchases” under “MD&A” and Note 22 to our “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance, data protection, incident management, resiliency, third party management, data transfer, security controls and account access mechanisms are in place.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and services or work with certain service providers, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see “Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security” under “Supervision and Regulation.”\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, debit products and checking accounts, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage.\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or\n33\nTable of Contents\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislation could be enacted in the countries in which we have operations. For example, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD’s guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent could impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. A number of countries, including the Member States in the EU, have adopted, or plan to adopt, these minimum tax guidelines starting in 2024, which we expect would impact our effective tax rate when the rules become effective. In addition to legislative changes, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities.\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately identified or mitigated. As regulations, technology and competition continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of certain financial instruments, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk, principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as gross domestic product, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer’s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but also by a customer’s other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us.\nWe rely principally on the customer’s creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customer's creditworthiness, including as a result of the\n34\nTable of Contents\ncurrent high rates of inflation and economic slowdown. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. We have experienced higher delinquency and write-off rates for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and such rates are expected to continue to increase. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where, for example, U.S. Card Members were responsible for approximately 87 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings. Our interest expense was approximately $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of approximately $141 million. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change. For example, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have recently raised interest rates in response to heightened inflationary pressures. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.” Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs. Our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.” Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Ratings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset- backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets. Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\nDuring 2022, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for obligations arising out of local Card Members’ spending outside\n35\nTable of Contents\nsuch country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately $4.6 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\n36\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nBUSINESS INTRODUCTION\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other.\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\nCredit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\nMerchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n\nNetwork services\n\nOther fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n\nExpense management products and services\n\nTravel and lifestyle services\nOur various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising.\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\nDiscount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant’s overall American Express- related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount.

Spending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which represented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed business grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise customers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent year-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending momentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the large pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our international billings.\n1\n1\n1\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased 36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a modest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\n1\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased versus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in 2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\n1\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy.\nDuring the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.\nOur performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and our strategy, and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on delivering sustainable and profitable growth.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” in “Business” for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for information on potential impacts of economic, geopolitical and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Business Segment Results of Operations” provide commentary on the variances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as presented in the accompanying tables. For a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, we made reporting presentation changes to our Consolidated Statements of Income to separately present revenues earned from processed volumes, previously reported in Discount revenue, Other fees and commissions and Other revenue, as Processed revenue. The remaining balances from Other fees and commissions and Other revenue were combined as Service fees and other revenue. We also disaggregated Marketing and business development expense into Business Development expense and Marketing expense. Prior period amounts presented herein have been recast to conform to the current period presentation; there was no impact to Total non-interest revenues or Total expenses.\nTABLE 2: TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nChange 2021 vs. 2020\nDiscount revenue Net card fees Service fees and other revenue Processed revenue\n$\n30,739 6,070 4,521 1,637\n$\n24,563 5,195 3,316 1,556\n$\n19,435 4,664 2,702 1,301\n$\n6,176 875 1,205 81\n25 % $ 17 36 5\n5,128 531 614 255\nTotal non-interest revenues\n42,967\n34,630\n28,102\n8,337\n24\n6,528\nTotal interest income Total interest expense\n12,658 2,763\n9,033 1,283\n10,083 2,098\n3,625 1,480\n40 #\n(1,050) (815)\nNet interest income\n9,895\n7,750\n7,985\n2,145\n28\n(235)\nTotal revenues net of interest expense\n$\n52,862\n$\n42,380\n$\n36,087\n$\n10,482\n25 % $\n6,293\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE\nDiscount revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in billed business of 23 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance.\nNet card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios.\nService fees and other revenue increased, primarily driven by foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending, higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, and growth in delinquency fees. The increase was partially offset by a non-cash gain related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value in the prior year.\nProcessed revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in processed volumes, partially offset by the prior-year repositioning of certain of our alternative payment solutions.\nInterest income increased, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loan balances and interest rates.\nInterest expense increased, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on deposits and debt outstanding.\n44\n26 % 11 23 20\n23\n(10) (39)\n(3)\n17 %\nTable of Contents\nTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUMMARY\nYears Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nChange 2021 vs. 2020\nCard Member loans Net write-offs Reserve build (release)\n(a)\n$\n1,066 448\n$\n879 (2,034)\n$\n2,170 1,283\n$\n187 2,482\n21 % $ #\n(1,291) (3,317)\nTotal\n1,514\n(1,155)\n3,453\n2,669\n#\n(4,608)\nCard Member receivables\nNet write-offs Reserve build (release)\n(a)\n462 165\n129 (202)\n881 134\n333 367\n# #\n(752) (336)\nTotal\n627\n(73)\n1,015\n700\n#\n(1,088)\nOther\n(b)\nNet write-offs — Other loans Net write-offs — Other receivables Reserve build (release) — Other loans Reserve (release) build — Other receivables\n(c)\n(a)(b)\nTotal\n(a)(c)\n22 15 7 (3) 41\n21 33 (185) (60) (191)\n111 27 66 58 262\n1 (18) 192 57 232\n5 (55) # 95 #\n(90) 6 (251) (118) (453)\nTotal provisions for credit losses\n$\n2,182\n$\n(1,419)\n$\n4,730\n$\n3,601\n# % $\n(6,149)\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more\n(a) Refer to the “Glossary of Selected Terminology” for a definition of reserve build (release).\n(b) Relates to Other loans of $5.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion less reserves of $59 million, $52 million and $238 million, as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(c) Relates to Other receivables included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $3.1 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion, less reserves of $22 million, $25 million and $85 million as\nof December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nCard Member loans and receivables provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to reserve builds in the current year, versus reserve releases in the prior year. The reserve builds in the current year were primarily driven by increases in loans and receivables outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves for Card Member loans. The reserve releases in the prior year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by increases in loans and receivables outstanding.\nOther provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to a net reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year. The net reserve build in the current year was primarily driven by increases in non-card loans outstanding, partially offset by improved credit performance. The reserve release in the prior year was due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts.\nRefer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding our reserves for credit losses.\n45\n(59)% #\n#\n(85) #\n#\n(81) 22 # # #\n# %\nTable of Contents\nTABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nChange 2021 vs. 2020\nCard Member rewards Business development Card Member services Marketing Salaries and employee benefits Other, net\n$\n14,002 4,943 2,959 5,458 7,252 6,481\n$\n11,007 3,762 1,993 5,291 6,240 4,817\n$\n8,041 3,051 1,230 3,696 5,718 5,325\n$\n2,995 1,181 966 167 1,012 1,664\n27 % $ 31 48 3 16 35\n2,966 711 763 1,595 522 (508)\nTotal expenses\n$\n41,095\n$\n33,110\n$\n27,061\n$\n7,985\n24 % $\n6,049\nEXPENSES\nCard Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $2.0 billion, and cobrand rewards expense of $1.0 billion, both of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories.\nThe Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nBusiness development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes.\nCard Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits.\nMarketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made.\nOther expenses increased, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6 percent and 24.6 percent for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current year related to the resolution of prior-year tax items. The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.\n46\n37 % 23 62 43 9 (10)\n22 %\nTable of Contents\nTABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nNetwork volumes (billions)\nBilled business Processed volumes Cards-in-force (millions)\nProprietary cards-in-force Basic cards-in-force (millions)\nProprietary basic cards-in-force\nAverage proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars) Average discount rate Average fee per card (dollars)\n(a)\n$ $ $\n$\n$\n1,552.8 1,338.3 214.5 133.3 76.7 111.5 59.1 23,496 2.34 % 82\n$ $ $\n$\n$\n1,284.2 1,089.8 194.4 121.7 71.4 100.7 54.7 20,392\n2.30 % 74\n$ $ $\n$\n$\n1,037.8 870.7 167.1 112.0 68.9 91.3 52.7 16,352\n2.28 % 67\n21 % 23 10 10 7 11 8 15\n11 %\n(a) Average fee per card is computed on an annualized basis based on proprietary Net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force.\nTABLE 6: NETWORK VOLUMES-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION\n2022\n2021\nYear over Year Percentage Increase (Decrease)\nPercentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX (a)\nRates\nYear over Year Percentage Increase (Decrease)\nNetwork volumes\nTotal billed business\nU.S. Consumer Services Commercial Services International Card Services\nProcessed volumes\n21 % 23 24 21 23 10\n24 % 25\n22 36 18\n24 % 25 32 21 22 16\nMerchant industry billed business metrics\nG&S-related (75% and 81% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively) T&E-related (25% and 19% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively) Airline-related (6% and 3% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n13 64 119 %\n16 67 125 %\n19 59 63 %\n(a) The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior-year period against which such results are being compared).\n47\nChange 2021 vs. 2020\n24 % 25 16 9 4 10 4 25\n10 %\nPercentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX (a)\nRates\n23 % 24\n20 18 14\n18 58 61 %\nTable of Contents\nTABLE 7: SELECTED CREDIT-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION As of or for the Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages and where indicated)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nCard Member loans: Card Member loans (billions) Credit loss reserves: Beginning balance\nProvisions — principal, interest and fees Net write-offs — principal less recoveries Net write-offs — interest and fees less recoveries\nOther\n(a)\n$\n$\n108.0\n3,305 1,514 (837) (229) (6)\n$\n$\n88.6\n5,344 (1,155) (672) (207) (5)\n$\n$\n73.4\n4,027 3,453 (1,795) (375) 34\n22 %\n(38) # 25 11\n(20)\nEnding balance\n$\n3,747\n$\n3,305\n$\n5,344\n13\n% of loans % of past due Average loans (billions) Net write-off rate — principal, interest and fees Net write-off rate — principal only 30+ days past due as a % of total\n(b)\n(b)\n$\n3.5 % 348 % 95.4 1.1 % 0.9 % 1.0 %\n$\n3.7 % 555 % 76.1 1.2 % 0.9 % 0.7 %\n$\n7.3 % 727 % 74.6 2.9 % 2.4 % 1.0 %\n25\nCard Member receivables: Card Member receivables (billions) Credit loss reserves: Beginning balance\nProvisions — principal and fees Net write-offs — principal and fees less recoveries\nOther\n(a)\nEnding balance % of receivables Net write-off rate — principal and fees\n(b)(c)(d)\n(c)\n$\n$\n$\n57.6\n64 627 (462) —\n229\n0.4 % 0.8 %\n$\n$\n$\n53.6\n267 (73) (129) (1)\n64\n0.1 % 0.3 %\n$\n$\n$\n43.7\n126 1,015 (881) 7\n267\n0.6 % 2.0 %\n7\n(76) # #\n# # %\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more\n(a) Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments.

Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.\n49\n2020\n7,985\n1,295 (668)\n8,612 74.6 10.7 % 11.5 %\nTable of Contents\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 1. “Business” for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment.\nEffective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods presented herein have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: USCS, CS, ICS and GMNS, with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate & Other. Refer to Note 24 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nResults of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, CS and ICS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue being allocated.\nNet card fees, processed revenue and certain other revenues are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.\nEXPENSES\nCard Member rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Business development and Marketing expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue.\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs, which primarily reflect salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, and overhead expenses. Service costs are allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses are allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.\n50\nTable of Contents\nU.S. CONSUMER SERVICES\nTABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA Years Ended December 31, (Millions, except percentages)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nChange 2022 vs. 2021\nChange 2021 vs. 2020\nRevenues\nNon-interest revenues Interest income Interest expense\n$\n16,440\n8,457 983\n$\n12,989\n6,328 395\n$\n10,125\n7,009 787\n$\n3,451 2,129 588\n27 % $ 34 #\n2,864 (681) (392)\nNet interest income\n7,474\n5,933\n6,222\n1,541\n26\n(289)\nTotal revenues net of interest expense Provisions for credit losses\n23,914 1,021\n18,922 (919)\n16,347 2,617\n4,992 1,940\n26 #\n2,575 (3,536)\nTotal revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses\n22,893\n19,841\n13,730\n3,052\n15\n6,111\nTotal expenses Pretax segment income\n$\n17,493\n5,400\n$\n13,883\n5,958\n$\n10,627\n3,103\n$\n3,610 (558)\n26 (9)% $\n3,256 2,855\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more\nUSCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products.\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE\nNon-interest revenues increased across all revenue categories, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Net card fees.\nDiscount revenue increased 25 percent, primarily driven by an increase in U.S. consumer billed business of 24 percent.

Net interest income increased, primarily due to a higher interest expense credit, largely driven by an increase in average merchant payables related to billed business growth and higher interest rates.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue, reflecting higher billed business, and increased Net interest income, primarily due to a higher interest expense credit, reflecting an increase in average merchant payables related to year-over-year billed business growth.\nEXPENSES\nTotal expenses increased, primarily driven by higher Salaries and employee benefits expense, reflecting higher compensation costs, as well as higher Business development expense, primarily resulting from increased partner payments driven by higher network volumes.\nTotal expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher Business development and Marketing expenses, reflecting increased partner payments, driven by higher network volumes, as well as increased spend on initiatives to support merchant engagement.\n60\n19 %\n(11) (12)\n8 19\n# 22\n12\n45 24 9 %\nTable of Contents\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCorporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other.\nCorporate & Other pretax loss was $2.2 billion and $1.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the pretax loss was primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year, a non-cash gain in the prior year related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value and higher compensation costs in the current year.\nCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:\n\nA solid and flexible equity capital profile;\n\nA broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and\n\nLiquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.\nWe continue to see volatility in the capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances.\nCAPITAL STRATEGY\nWe believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See “Dividends and Share Repurchases” below.\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations.\nWe seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio.\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries.\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022:\nTABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS\nEffective Minimum\n(a)\nRatios as of December 31, 2022\nRisk-Based Capital\nCommon Equity Tier 1\n7.0 %\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n10.3 % 11.3\nTier 1\n8.5\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n11.1 11.3\nTotal\n10.5\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n12.8 13.2\nTier 1 Leverage\n4.0 %\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n9.9 9.7 %\n(a) Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express\nCompany and the capital conservation buffer for AENB.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets.\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below.\n62\nTable of Contents\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information on our preferred shares.\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter.\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under Part 1, Item 1. “Business - Supervision and Regulation” for additional details.\nAs a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022.\nDIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES\nWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we returned $4.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.6 billion and share repurchases of $3.3 billion. We repurchased 20 million common shares at an average price of $168.14 in 2022. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 64 percent of total capital generated during the year.\nWe plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately 15 percent, from 52 cents to 60 cents per share, beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $57 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our preferred shares.\nOur decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements; regulatory guidance or restrictions, actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions; revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve’s authorization of our capital plan; and the supervisory stress test process. We may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate.\n63\nTable of Contents\nFUNDING STRATEGY\nOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits, unsecured debt and asset securitizations, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility.\nWe expect the balance of our direct deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.\nFUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\nWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:\nTABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT (Billions)\n2022\nCustomer deposits Short-term borrowings Long-term debt\n$\n110.2 1.3 42.6\n$\nTotal customer deposits and debt\n$\n154.1\n$\nWe may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities.\nOur funding plan for the full year 2023 includes, among other sources, approximately $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nOur equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost- effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately.\n64\n2021\n84.4 2.2 38.7\n125.3\nTable of Contents\nTABLE 19: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS\nAmerican Express Entity\nMoody's\nS&P\nLong Term\nA2\nBBB+\nAmerican Express Company\nShort Term\nN/A\nA-2\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nLong Term\nA2\nA-\nAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.\nShort Term\nPrime-1\nA-2\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nLong Term\nA3\nA-\nAmerican Express National Bank\nShort Term\nPrime-1\nA-2\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nLong Term\nA2\nA-\nAmerican Express Credit Corporation\nShort Term\nN/A\nN/A\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nThese ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.\nDowngrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.\nDEPOSIT PROGRAMS\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2022, we had $110.2 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\nSHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS\nShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. We had no commercial paper outstanding at any point during 2022. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings.\n65\nFitch\nA\nF1\nStable\nA\nF1\nStable\nA\nF1\nStable\nA\nN/A\nStable\nTable of Contents\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $42.6 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further description of our asset securitizations.\nTABLE 20: DEBT ISSUANCES (Billions)\nAmerican Express Company:\nFixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon rate of 3.60%) Floating Rate Senior Notes (compounded SOFR Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes (4.42% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR period) Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (4.989% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR plus 2.255% during the floating rate period) American Express Credit Account Master Trust:\n(a)\nplus weighted-average spread of 83 basis points)\n(a)\nplus 1.76% during the floating rate\n(a)\n$\nFixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 3.51%)\nTotal\n$\n(a)\nSecured overnight financing rate (SOFR).\n66\n2022\n10.2 1.0\n1.2\n0.8\n7.3\n20.5\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\nOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.\nOur liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\nMaintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the “Funding Strategy” section for more details);\nMaintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;\n\nProjecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and\n\nEstablishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nThe amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements.\nThe investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The level of future net interest income or costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.\n67\nTable of Contents\nSecuritized Borrowing Capacity\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility.\nFederal Reserve Discount Window\nAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $102.8 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.\nCommitted Bank Credit Facility\nIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, as of December 31, 2022 we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion with a maturity date of October 15, 2024. The availability of the credit facility is subject to our maintenance of a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, with certain restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our CET1 risk- based capital ratio falls between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent. It does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility. We use this facility from time to time in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have certain off-balance sheet obligations that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain Card Member and partner arrangements that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. For more information on these obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 15 and Note 23 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n68\nTable of Contents\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021:\nTABLE 21: CASH FLOWS\n(Billions)\n2022\n2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in): Operating activities Investing activities Financing activities Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n$\n21.1 (33.7) 24.5 —\n$\n14.6 (10.5) (14.9) (0.1)\n$\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n11.9\n$\n(10.9)\n$\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.\nIn 2022, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability related to growth in billed business.\nIn 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from an increase in Membership Rewards liability and higher accounts payable to merchants related to growth in billed business.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\nIn 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending and net purchases of investment securities.\nIn 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending, partially offset by net maturities of our investment securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.\nIn 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from debt, partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments.\nIn 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares.\n69\n2020\n5.6 11.6 (9.1) 0.4\n8.5\nTable of Contents\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nGOVERNANCE\nWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, measure, report and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.\nRisk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, risk profile and performance, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks.\nThe Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite, including credit risk (at both the individual and institutional levels), operational risk (e.g., operations, legal, conduct, third-party, information technology, information security, data management, privacy and people risks), compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk, country risk and environmental, social and governance risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward- looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring performance (including limits and escalation triggers) and assessing control programs.\nThe Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks and exposures.\nThe Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations.\nThe Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, and our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including the CCAR submissions.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves Internal Audit’s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan’s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions.\nThe Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk- balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nAs defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define credit risk as loss due to default or changes in the credit quality of a customer, obligor or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer.\nIndividual Credit Risk\nIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\nThe business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate.\nCredit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers.\nInstitutional Credit Risk\nInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our CS, ICS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios.\n71\nTable of Contents\nSimilar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors.\nExposure to the Airline and Travel Industry\nWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See “We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations” and “Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nDebt Exposure\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2022, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material.\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties.\nTo appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the ERMC. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls. It also oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. We use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments.\nThe framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective.\n72\nTable of Contents\nInformation and Cyber Security\nWe define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of American Express customer, colleague or proprietary information.\nOur information and cyber security program is designed to protect information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem.\nSee “A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nInformation Technology\nWe define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing, stability, capacity, performance, or resilience of information technology and cause financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts.\nWe manage information technology risk through our policies, procedures, governance structure, and control framework to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and processes across our Company.\nSee “The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” under “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nPrivacy\nWe define privacy risk as the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory or legal action resulting from decisions related to the violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, or the non-adherence to privacy policies, disclosures, or standards that apply to the processing of personal data.\nThe Global Privacy Policy establishes the privacy framework and defines the American Express Data Protection & Privacy Principles, which governs the way we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete or otherwise process our customer and colleague personal data globally. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, the Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program.\nData Management and Governance\nWe define data management and governance risk as the risk of financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts due to inadequate data governance and/or data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, comprehensiveness or usability of data throughout its lifecycle.\nOur Enterprise Data Governance Policy establishes the framework for defining in-scope critical data and the requirements for managing such data effectively throughout its lifecycle as a critical corporate asset. This policy is approved by the ERMC.\nChaired by the Chief Data Officer, our Enterprise Data Committee, a sub-committee of the ERMC, provides governance and oversight for our enterprise-wide data governance and management activities.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThird Party Risk\nWe define third party risk as the risk that relationships with third parties (including their significant subcontractors) create unexpected outcomes and deviations from expectations or stated obligations. The Third Party Management Policy is approved by the Risk Committee of our Board and the ERMC. It sets forth the procurement, risk management, and contracting framework for managing third-party relationships commensurate with their risk and complexity. Our Third Party Lifecycle Management program sets guidelines for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and reporting the risk associated with third parties through the life cycle of the relationships, which includes planning, due diligence and third-party selection, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination.\nConduct Risk\nWe define conduct risk as the risk that colleagues, intentionally or unintentionally, fail to fulfill their responsibilities to American Express, our customers, colleagues or stakeholders in a manner consistent with our Code of Conduct, policies and values as well as applicable laws and regulations. Conduct issues also have the potential to increase several other risk types, including reputational risk, which may undermine the integrity and trust upon which our brand is built.\nThe Conduct Risk Management Policy is approved by the ERMC. It establishes the governance framework for conduct risk across the Company. The policy requires annual risk assessments, implementation of detective and preventive controls, colleague training and timely escalations of conduct issues. It also provides guidance on consequence management for any substantiated cases of misconduct. The Conduct Risk Committee oversees conduct risk related topics and escalates such matters to the ERMC, as appropriate.\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, internal policies and procedures and related practices, or ethical standards.\nWe view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee.\nWe have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. The program includes an independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance.\nREPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny.\nWe view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success.\nOur business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC.\n74\nTable of Contents\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define market risk as the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include (i) interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits) and (ii) foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nOur risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the ERMC, Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee.\nMarket risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $141 million on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude, subject to applicable interest rate caps or floors, as benchmark rates change. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2022, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $34 billion were outstanding.\n75\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2022. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2022. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be approximately $153 million as of December 31, 2022.\nTo a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits.\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.\nFUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define funding and liquidity risk as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due.\nOur Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management.\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event.\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken.\nMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes.\nThe Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk. This policy is approved by the ERMC. The comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences.\n76\nTable of Contents\nSTRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services.\nStrategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees.\nCOUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nWe define country risk as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a country present. They might adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital.\nWe manage country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) AND CLIMATE-RELATED RISK\nWe define climate-related risk as: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market and reputational risks, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes, floods) and chronic physical risk which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves). Such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact on our customers, operations, suppliers and business.\nClimate-related risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk or other risk types. We continue to enhance our focus on climate-related risk within our risk governance framework. We are currently performing a risk identification process for climate-related risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk. Furthermore, ESG risks, with an emphasis on climate-related risk, are currently identified as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows:\nRESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER CREDIT LOSSES\nReserves for Card Member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date.\nIn estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and internal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit losses.\nThe R&S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card Member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the R&S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card Member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off no later than 180 days past due.\nWithin the R&S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance.\nCECL requires that the R&S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect management's judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models.\n78\nTable of Contents\nMacroeconomic Sensitivity\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario. As of December 31, 2022, for every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $120 million.\nThe modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.\nIn addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management’s judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date, or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\nRefer to Note 3 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs described above, to calculate reserves for Card Member credit losses.\nThe process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period.\n79\nTable of Contents\nLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS\nThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $157 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $190 million.\nGOODWILL RECOVERABILITY\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.\n80\nTable of Contents\nOur methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.\nWhen preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units’ operating results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units.\nWe could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management’s current assumptions.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements.\nIn establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate.\nTax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax.\nDeferred Tax Asset Realization\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nSince deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information.\nChanges in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties.\n81\nTable of Contents\nOTHER MATTERS\nAs previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. We completed our review of this matter in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in an immaterial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to the Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\nAdjusted net interest income — A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans.\nAirline-related volume — Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&E-related volume.\nAsset securitizations — Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAverage discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue.\nBilled business (Card Member spending) — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express.\nCapital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions under Basel III.\nCard Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\nCard Member loans — Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\nCard Member receivables — Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\nCards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out- of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\nCharge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n82\nTable of Contents\nCobrand cards — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program.\nCredit cards — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.\nDiscount revenue — Discount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express.\nGoods and Services (G&S)-related volume — Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments.\nInterest expense — Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.\nInterest income — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.\nInterest on loans — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.\nInterest and dividends on investment securities — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.\nInterest income on deposits with banks and other — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.\nLoyalty coalitions — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.\nNet card fees — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.\nNet interest yield on average Card Member loans — A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.\nNet write-off rate — principal only — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.\nNet write-off rate — principal, interest and fees — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.\nNetwork volumes — Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes.\nOperating expenses — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.\n83\nTable of Contents\nProcessed revenue — Represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. Processed revenue also includes fees earned on alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express.\nProcessed volumes — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express.\nReserve build (release) — Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.\nT&E-related volume — Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.\n84\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets;\n\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control —Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on management’s assessment and those criteria, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n88\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of American Express Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n89\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nReserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company’s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company’s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period, the Company’s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n90\nTable of Contents\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&S Period.\nMembership Rewards Liability\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management’s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management’s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness and (iii) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management’s estimate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 10, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\n91\nTable of Contents\nINDEX TO

providing customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are credit and charge card products, along with travel and lifestyle related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid- sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising.\nRefer to Note 24 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nWe consolidate entities in which we hold a “controlling financial interest.” For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees’ operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity’s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE.\nEntities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY\nTransactions conducted in currencies other than the applicable functional currency of an entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using period end rates. The resulting transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities and results of operations are translated for consolidation purposes into U.S. dollars at period-end rates for monetary assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders’ equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations.\n98\nTable of Contents\nAMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management’s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\nINCOME STATEMENT\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. We are not required to disclose revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g., discount revenue). Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to all other contracts with customers is not material.\nDiscount Revenue\nDiscount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant’s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid- sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our network partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\nNet Card Fees\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nService Fees and Other Revenue\nService fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees, which are generally recognized in the period when the service is performed, and delinquency and foreign currency-related fees, which are primarily recognized in the period when they are charged to the Card Member. In addition, Service fees and other revenue includes income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence and therefore account for under the equity method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\nProcessed Revenue\nProcessed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we settle with merchants and our third-party merchant acquirers on behalf of our network card issuing partners. The amount of fees charged for accepting American Express-branded cards is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant or third-party merchant acquirer and recorded as Processed revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contra-revenue within Processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer, after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as expense in Business development. Processed revenue also includes fees related to alternative payment solutions, which are generally recognized when the service is performed.\n99\nTable of Contents\nContra-revenue\nPayments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, network partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense.\nInterest Income\nInterest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off.\nInterest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security’s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.\nInterest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt.\nCard Member Rewards\nWe issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make associated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBusiness Development\nBusiness development expense includes payments to our cobrand partners, corporate client incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets and certain payments to network partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred.\nCard Member Services\nCard Member services expense represents costs incurred in providing our Card Members with various value-added benefits and services, which are generally expensed as incurred.\nMarketing\nMarketing expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the period in which the advertising first takes place. All other marketing expenses are generally expensed as incurred.\n100\nTable of Contents\nBALANCE SHEET\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment.\nThis qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the reporting unit's fair value.\nWhen measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units’ operating results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our operating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Refer to Note 24 for further information on the realignment of our operating segments.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date.\nCertain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the specific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets.\n101\nTable of Contents\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease.

The amendments eliminate the existing TDR guidance for those entities that have adopted Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, create a single loan modification accounting model and enhance disclosure requirements for loan modifications and write-offs. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2023, our financial statements will reflect the adoption of this standard on a prospective basis. The updated guidance will not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology resulting in an increase in the reserves for total loans and receivables credit losses on adoption, which was recorded under a modified retrospective transition with an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 3 for how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology.\n103\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2\nLOANS AND CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES\nOur lending and charge payment card products that we offer to consumer, small business and corporate customers result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables. We also extend credit to customers through non-card financing products, resulting in Other loans.\nCARD MEMBER AND OTHER LOANS\nCard Member loans are generally recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any finance charges and associated card-related fees. Card Members with outstanding revolving loans are required to make a minimum monthly payment, and the balances that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. These loans have varying terms such as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members, and in accordance with applicable regulations and the respective product’s terms and conditions.\nCard Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. Our policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves for interest that we believe will not be collected.\nOther loans are recorded at the time any extension of credit is provided to consumer and commercial customers for non-card financing products. These loans have a range of fixed terms such as interest rates, fees and repayment periods. Borrowers are typically required to make pre-established monthly payments over the term of the loan. Non-card financing products are not associated with a Card Member agreement, and instead are governed by a separate borrowing relationship. Other loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses, and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees.\nCard Member and Other loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of: (Millions)\n2022\n(a)\nConsumer Small Business Corporate\n$\n84,964 22,947 53\n$\nCard Member loans Less: Reserves for credit losses\n107,964 3,747\nCard Member loans, net\n$\n104,217\n$\nOther loans, net\n(b)\n$\n5,357\n$\n(a)\nIncludes approximately $28.5 billion and $26.6 billion of gross Card Member loans available to settle obligations of a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b) Other loans represent consumer and commercial non-card financing products, and Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.

A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member’s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan or receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b).\n(b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes.

We consider impaired loans and receivables to include (i) loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest, (ii) non-accrual loans and (iii) loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).\nIn instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty, we may modify, through various financial relief programs, loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability, while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief. We have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as TDRs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a TDR, with such accounts identified as “Out of Program TDRs.”\nSuch modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include (i) temporary interest rate reductions (possibly as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in our TDR disclosures), (ii) placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program. Upon entering the modification program, the customer’s ability to make future purchases is either limited, canceled, or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the customer, loans and/or receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate where applicable) when the customer exits the modification program, which is (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the customer defaults out of the modification program.\nReserves for modifications deemed TDRs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model.

The CECL methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), which is approximately three years, beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses.\nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the R&S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&S Period. Beyond the R&S Period, we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates.\n•\n\nPD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off. EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios, the EAD models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors. Recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from Card Members after default occurs, typically as a result of collection efforts. Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions.\nWe also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions, even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses. Our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses.\nFuture economic conditions that are incorporated over the R&S Period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. Management reviews these economic scenarios each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product (GDP), that are significant to our models.\nWe also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. We consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves (higher or lower) to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\nLifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity, including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics, such as past spend and remittance behaviors, credit bureau scores where available, delinquency status, tenure of balance outstanding, amongst others. Credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of Reserves for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and within the Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than reversing interest income. Separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring, which are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. See Note 2 for information on troubled debt restructurings.\nLoans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than 180 days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and 120 days past due for term loans. Loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification.\n112\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs, to calculate reserves for credit losses: U.S. Unemployment Rate\nU.S. GDP Growth (Contraction)\n(a)\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nFourth quarter of 2022 First quarter of 2023 Fourth quarter of 2023 Fourth quarter of 2024\n4% 3% - 6% 3% - 8% 3% - 7%\n4% - 9% 3% - 9% 3% - 7% 4% - 6%\n(0.1)% 5% - (1)% 6% - 0.2% 3% - 2%\n2% -1% 3% - 1% 4% - 3% 3%\n(a) Real GDP quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates.\nCHANGES IN CARD MEMBER LOANS RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nCard Member loans reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in loans outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves.\nCard Member loans reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding.\nThe following table presents changes in the Card Member loans reserve for credit losses for the years ended December 31: 2022 (Millions)\n2021\n2020\nBeginning Balance\nProvisions Net write-offs Principal Interest and fees\n(a)\n(b)\nOther\n(c)\n$\n3,305 1,514\n(837) (229) (6)\n$\n5,344 (1,155)\n(672) (207) (5)\n$\n4,027 3,453\n(1,795) (375) 34\nEnding Balance\n$\n3,747\n$\n3,305\n$\n5,344\n(a)\nProvisions for principal, interest and fee reserve components.

The methodology for estimating credit losses for available for sale debt securities requires us to estimate lifetime credit losses for all available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. When estimating a security’s probability of default and the recovery rate, we assess the security’s credit indicators, including credit ratings. If our assessment indicates that an estimated credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the estimated credit loss through the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other loans Provision for credit losses. Unrealized gains and any portion of a security’s unrealized loss attributable to non-credit losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of tax. We had accrued interest on our available-for-sale debt securities totaling $12 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, presented as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other, net expense.\nRealized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other, net expense.\nRefer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of investment securities.\nThe following is a summary of investment securities as of December 31:\n2022\n2021\nDescription of Securities (Millions)\nCost\nGross Unrealized Gains\nGross Unrealized Losses\nEstimated Fair Value\nCost\nGross Unrealized Gains\nGross Unrealized Losses\nEstimated Fair Value\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities: State and municipal obligations U.S. Government agency obligations U.S. Government treasury obligations Mortgage-backed securities Foreign government bonds and obligations Other\n(a)\n(b)\n$\n64 $ 5 3,859 13 633\n47\n— — — — —\n—\n$\n(10) — (73) — (1)\n—\n$\n54 $ 5 3,786 13 632\n47\n106 $ 6 1,680 17 630\n43\n5 — 25 1 —\n—\n$\n— — (1) — —\n—\n$\n111 6 1,704 18 630\n43\nEquity securities\n(c)\n50\n—\n(9)\n41\n66\n17\n(4)\n79\nTotal\n$\n4,671 $\n—\n$\n(93)\n$\n4,578 $\n2,548 $\n48\n$\n(5)\n$\n2,591\n(a) Represents mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.\n(b) Represents investments in debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions.

The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors.\nThe Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts’ economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. Our ownership of variable interests in the Lending Trust was $16.0 billion and $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and in the Charge Trust was $5.2 billion and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts.\nThe debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8).\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust was $59 million and $42 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and by the Charge Trust was nil and $1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.\nUnder the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such triggering events occurred.\n117\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 6\nOTHER ASSETS\nThe following is a summary of Other assets as of December 31: (Millions)\n2022\nGoodwill Other intangible assets, at amortized cost Other\n(a)\n$\n3,786 146 13,757\n$\nTotal\n$\n17,689\n$\n(a)\nPrimarily includes net deferred tax assets, other receivables net of reserves, investments in non-consolidated entities, prepaid assets, tax credit investments and right-of-use lease assets.\nGOODWILL\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill reported in our reportable operating segments were as follows: (Millions)\nUSCS\nCS\nICS\nGMNS\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 Acquisitions Dispositions (a) Other\n$\n369 — — (1)\n$\n2,124 — — (1)\n$\n799 — (3) (43)\n$\n560 — — —\n$\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 Acquisitions Dispositions (a) Other\n$\n368 13 — (2)\n$\n2,123 — — (1)\n$\n753 — — (28)\n$\n560 — — —\n$\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n379\n$\n2,122\n$\n725\n$\n560\n$\n(a)\nPrimarily includes foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our operating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Accumulated impairment losses were $221 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years. We review long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset or asset group’s fair value.\nThe gross carrying amount for other intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $720 million and $733 million, respectively, with accumulated amortization of $574 million and $532 million, respectively.\nAmortization expense was $51 million, $57 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For other intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, amortization expense is expected to be $49 million in 2023, $44 million in 2024, $20 million in 2025, $10 million in 2026, $9 million in 2027 and $14 million thereafter.\n118\n2021\n3,804 201 13,239\n17,244\nTotal\n3,852 — (3) (45)\n3,804 13 — (31)\n3,786\nTable of Contents\nTAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS\nWe account for our qualified affordable housing (QAH) investments using the proportional amortization method (PAM), which we elected to implement on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis, and other tax credit investments using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1,207 million and $1,124 million in tax credit investments, respectively, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $1,146 million and $1,084 million, respectively, related to QAH investments. Included in QAH investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $980 million and $994 million, respectively, related to investments in unconsolidated VIEs for which we do not have a controlling financial interest.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we committed to provide funding related to certain of these QAH investments, which is expected to be paid between 2023 and 2040, resulting in $348 million in unfunded commitments reported in Other liabilities, of which $222 million specifically related to unconsolidated VIEs.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2022 we had contractual off-balance sheet obligations to provide additional funding up to $13 million for these QAH investments, fully related to unconsolidated VIEs. We may be required to fund these amounts between 2023 and 2036.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized QAH investment losses of $161 million and $226 million, respectively, with associated tax credits of $141 million and $135 million, respectively, in Income tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we recognized QAH investment equity method losses of $128 million, in Other, net expenses, with associated tax credits of $129 million, recognized in Income tax provision.\n119\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 7\nCUSTOMER DEPOSITS\nAs of December 31, customer deposits were categorized as interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing as follows:\n(Millions)\nU.S.:\nInterest-bearing Non-interest-bearing (includes Card Member credit balances of: 2022, $605; 2021, $527)\nNon-U.S.:\nInterest-bearing Non-interest-bearing (includes Card Member credit balances of: 2022, $439; 2021, $503)\nTotal customer deposits\nCustomer deposits by deposit type as of December 31 were as follows: (Millions)\nSavings and transaction accounts Certificates of deposit:\nDirect Third-party (brokered)\nSweep accounts ―Third-party (brokered) Other deposits Card Member credit balances\nTotal customer deposits\nThe scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: 2025 (Millions)\n2023\n2024\n2026\nCertificates of deposit\n$\n5,790\n$\n6,554\n$\n2,939\n$\n27\nAs of December 31, certificates of deposit in denominations of $250,000 or more, in the aggregate, were as follows:\n(Millions)\nU.S. Non-U.S.\nTotal\n120\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n2027\n786\n$\n$\n$\n2022\n109,119 663\n$\n15 442\n110,239\n$\n2022\n76,731\n$\n2,765 13,331 16,297 71 1,044\n110,239\n$\nAfter 5 years\n—\n2022\n998 1\n$\n999\n$\n$\n2021\n83,304 553\n18 507\n84,382\n2021\n66,142\n1,415 3,095 12,658 42 1,030\n84,382\nTotal\n16,096\n2021\n521 1\n522\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 8\nDEBT\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\nOur short-term borrowings outstanding, defined as borrowings with original contractual maturity dates of less than one year, as of December 31 were as follows:\n2022\n2021\n(Millions, except percentages) Short-term borrowings\n(b)\n$\nOutstanding Balance 1,348\nYear-End Stated Interest Rate on (a)\nDebt 0.94 % $\nOutstanding Balance 2,243\nTotal\n$\n1,348\n0.94 % $\n2,243\n(a)\nFor floating-rate issuances, the stated interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding principal balances and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(b)\nIncludes borrowings from banks and book overdrafts with banks due to timing differences arising in the ordinary course of business.\nWe maintained a three-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible certificates issued from the Lending Trust at any time through September 16, 2024.

We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management’s best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\nThe expense for Membership Rewards points is included in Card Member rewards expense. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.\nDEFERRED CARD AND OTHER FEES, NET\nThe carrying amount of deferred card and other fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs and reserves for membership cancellations, as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: (Millions)\n2022\nDeferred card and other fees Deferred direct acquisition costs Reserves for membership cancellations\n(a)\n$\n3,380 (173) (180)\n$\nDeferred card and other fees, net\n$\n3,027\n$\n(a)\nIncludes deferred fees for Membership Rewards program participants.\n124\n2021\n11,398 2,516 2,528 1,809 1,576 10,670\n30,497\n2021\n2,838 (169) (153)\n2,516\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nSTOCK OPTION AND AWARD PROGRAMS\nUnder our 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (amended and restated effective May 5, 2020) and previously under our 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, Incentive Compensation Plans), awards may be granted to employees and other key individuals who perform services for us and our participating subsidiaries.

We generally issue new common shares upon exercise of options and vesting of RSUs.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized in Salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $373 million, $326 million and $247 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with corresponding income tax benefits of $90 million, $78 million and $59 million in those respective periods.\nA summary of stock option and RSU activity as of December 31, 2022, and corresponding changes during the year, are as follows:\nStock Options\nService-Based RSUs\nService and Performance-Based RSUs\n(Shares in thousands)\nShares\nWeighted-Average Exercise Price\nShares\nWeighted- Average Grant Price\nShares\nWeighted- Average Grant Price\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 Granted Options exercised/RSUs vested Forfeited Expired\n3,104 1,168 (638) — —\n$\n93.33 154.57 88.81 — —\n1,875 798 (751) (134) —\n$\n117.36 174.48 113.19 139.77 —\n3,741 1,064 (1,097) (236) —\n$\n114.22 163.60 89.58 137.42 —\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022\n3,634\n113.80\n1,788\n$\n142.92\n3,472\n$\n135.57\nOptions vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022\n3,607\n113.54\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2022\n1,699\n$\n80.57\nStock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably based on the grant-date fair value of the awards, net of expected forfeitures, over the vesting period. Generally, the vesting period is the shorter of the vesting schedule as defined in each award agreement or the date an individual will become eligible to retire. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and/or years of service.\nSTOCK OPTIONS\nEach stock option has an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term of 10 years from the date of grant.\nThe fair value of options without market conditions is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nDividend yield Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Expected life of stock option (in years) Weighted-average fair value per option\n(a)\n(b)\n$\n1.0 % 31 % 1.7 % 7.1\n55.30\n$\n1.5 % 31 % 0.8 % 7.2\n32.38\n$\n1.4 % 20 % 1.6 % 7.1\n25.83\n(a) The expected volatility is based on both weighted historical and implied volatilities of our common stock price.\n(b) The expected life of stock options was determined using both historical data and expectations of option exercise behavior.\nCertain executives were awarded a grant of stock options on October 31, 2022 that vest, subject to achieving performance and market conditions. These options vest in tranches on the third and fourth anniversaries from the grant date, subject to continued employment through the applicable anniversary, and have a contractual term of seven years. The fair value was estimated at the\n125\nTable of Contents\ngrant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model assuming a dividend yield of 1.4 percent, expected volatility (based on both weighted historical and implied volatilities of our common stock price) of 34 percent, risk-free rate of 3.9 percent and an expected life of seven years, resulting in a fair value of $50.10.\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\nOutstanding\nExercisable\nWeighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (millions)\n$\n5.6 131\n$\n3.6 114\n$\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $46 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.0 years.\nFor stock options that were exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020, the intrinsic value, based upon the fair value of our stock price at the date the options were exercised, was $56 million, $86 million and $47 million, respectively; cash received by the Company from the exercise of stock options was $56 million, $64 million and $44 million during those respective periods. The income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to stock option exercises was $9 million, $14 million and $7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS/AWARDS\nWe grant RSUs that contain either a) service conditions or b) both service and performance conditions. RSUs containing only service conditions generally vest ratably over three years, or four years for awards granted prior to 2022, beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. RSUs containing both service and performance conditions generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, and the number of shares earned depends on the achievement of predetermined Company metrics. RSU holders receive dividend equivalents or dividends.\nPerformance-based RSUs include a relative total shareholder return (r-TSR) modifier so that our actual shareholder return relative to a comparable peer group is one of the performance conditions that determines the number of shares ultimately issued upon vesting.\nThe fair value of RSUs that do not include the r-TSR modifier, including those that contain only service conditions, is measured using our stock price on the grant date. The fair value of service and performance-based RSUs that include the r-TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions in 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n2022\n2021\nExpected volatility Risk-free interest rate Remaining performance period (in years)\n(a)\n42 % 1.4 % 2.9\n41 % 0.2 % 2.9\n(a) The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $247 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.7 years.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $168.26, $123.66 and $124.47, respectively.\nFor RSUs vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020, the total fair value, based upon our stock price at the date the RSUs vested, was $323 million, $227 million and $291 million, respectively.\nLIABILITY-BASED AWARDS\nOther incentive awards can be settled with cash or equity shares at our discretion and final Compensation and Benefits Committee approval. These awards are generally settled with cash and thus are classified as liabilities; therefore, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and remeasured quarterly as part of compensation expense over the vesting period. Cash paid upon vesting of these awards in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $50 million, $53 million and $81 million, respectively.\n126\nVested and Expected to Vest\n5.6 131\n2020\n19 % 1.4 % 2.9\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 11\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS\nWe sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, the principal plan being the Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), a 401(k) savings plan with a profit-sharing component. The RSP is a tax-qualified retirement plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and covers most employees in the United States. The total expense for all defined contribution retirement plans globally was $259 million, $269 million and $267 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\nOur primary defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the United States and United Kingdom are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits. Some employees outside the United States and United Kingdom are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. We comply with minimum funding requirements in all countries. We also sponsor unfunded other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance to certain retired U.S. employees. For these plans, the total net benefit was $24 million, $26 million and $8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the unfunded status related to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans was $278 million and $414 million, respectively, and is recorded in Other liabilities.\n127\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 12\nCONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS\nCONTINGENCIES\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings).\nBased on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we do not believe we are a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below.\nOn February 25, 2020, we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, captioned Laurelwood Cleaners LLC v. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction in California prohibiting American Express from enforcing its anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions and from requiring merchants “to offer the service of Amex-card acceptance for free.” The case has been stayed pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings.\nOn January 29, 2019, we were named in a putative class action brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Anthony Oliver, et al. v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc., in which the plaintiffs are holders of MasterCard, Visa and/or Discover credit cards (but not American Express cards) and allege they paid higher prices as a result of our anti-steering and non- discrimination provisions in violation of federal antitrust law and the antitrust and consumer laws of various states. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other forms of relief. The court dismissed plaintiffs’ federal antitrust claim, numerous state antitrust and consumer protection claims and their unjust enrichment claim. The remaining claims in plaintiffs’ complaint arise under the antitrust laws of 11 states and the consumer protection laws of six states.\nOn March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam’s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned B&R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam’s Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al., for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California’s Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On August 28, 2020, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification.\nIn July 2004, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Co., et al., in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages.\n128\nTable of Contents\nIn 2006, Mawarid Investments Limited filed a request for confidential arbitration under the 1998 London Court of International Arbitration Rules in connection with certain claims arising under a shareholders agreement between Mawarid and TRS relating to a joint venture between the parties, Amex (Middle East) BSC(c) (AEME). In 2008, the tribunal rendered a partial award, including a direction that an audit should take place to verify whether acquirer discount revenue related to transactions occurring with airlines located in the Middle East region had been properly allocated to AEME since its inception in 1992. In September 2021, the tribunal rendered a further partial award regarding the location of transactions through non-physical channels. In May 2022, the tribunal further clarified the 2021 partial award and the discount rate that should apply to transactions through non-physical channels. A final award is now expected in 2023.\nIn May 2020, we began responding to a review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Protection Bureau (CFPB) pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January 2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against us at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against us seeking fines or other remedial actions. We are cooperating with all inquiries.\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting.\nOur legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages sought, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss.\nWe have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable.\nFor those disclosed legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $200 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This range represents management’s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals. In addition, it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n129\nTable of Contents\nCOMMITMENTS\nTotal lease expense includes rent expenses, adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $188 million, $161 million and $177 million, respectively.\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. For lease liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term was 19 years and the weighted average rate used to discount lease commitments was 3 percent.\nThe following represents the maturities of our outstanding lease commitments as of December 31, 2022:\n(Millions)\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter\nTotal Outstanding Fixed Lease Payments\nLess: Amount representing interest\nLease Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.0 billion in financial commitments outstanding related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to ten years. Such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payment we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members’ spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we generally pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points.\n130\n$\n$\n$\n$\n157 144 121 105 93 892\n1,512\n(539)\n973\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 13\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes.\nMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include:\n\nInterest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and\n\nForeign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nWe centrally monitor market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in our Asset/Liability Management Policy. Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services.\nInterest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings, as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime, the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight indexed swap rate. Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. We may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forwards.\nDerivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. We manage this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by us and rated as investment grade, and counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored.\nA majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. Accordingly, where appropriate, we have elected to present derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, we exercise our rights under executed credit support agreements with the respective derivative counterparties for our bilateral interest rate swaps and select foreign exchange contracts. These agreements require that, in the event the fair value change in the net derivatives position between the two parties exceeds certain dollar thresholds, the party in the net liability position posts collateral to its counterparty. All derivative contracts cleared through a central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contracts.\nIn relation to our credit risk, certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position. As of December 31, 2022, these derivatives were not in a material net liability position and we had no material risk exposure to any individual derivative counterparty. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required.\n131\nTable of Contents\nOur derivatives are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the instruments’ intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below. Refer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of derivatives.\nThe following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31:\nOther Assets Fair Value\nOther Liabilities Fair Value\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\n2022\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments: Fair value hedges - Interest rate contracts Net investment hedges - Foreign exchange contracts\n(a)\n$\n— 350\n$\n204 219\n$\n211 251\n$\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\n350\n423\n462\nForeign exchange contracts and other\n171\n167\n339\nTotal derivatives, gross Derivative asset and derivative liability netting (c) Cash collateral netting\n(b)\n521 (257) (11)\n590 (93) (204)\n801 (257) (212)\nTotal derivatives, net\n$\n253\n$\n293\n$\n332\n$\n(a)\nFor our centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral.\n(b) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement.\n(c) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to cash collateral held from the counterparty or cash collateral\nposted with the counterparty.\nWe posted $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nDerivatives executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented and designated as such when we enter into the contracts. In accordance with our risk management policies, we structure our hedges with terms similar to those of the item being hedged. We formally assess, at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. These assessments usually are made through the application of a regression analysis method. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nA fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof, that is attributable to a particular risk.\nInterest Rate Contracts\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We had $8.1 billion and $12.9 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGains or losses on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the losses or gains on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the hedged item may not fully offset due to differences between a debt obligation’s interest rate and the benchmark rate, primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap.\n132\n2021\n— 54\n54\n85\n139 (93) (4)\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the years ended December 31:\nGains (losses)\n(Millions)\n2022\n2021\nFixed-rate long-term debt Derivatives designated as hedging instruments\n$\n473 (476)\n$\n385 (385)\n$\nTotal\n$\n(3)\n$\n—\n$\nThe carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $7.8 billion and $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments of $(236) million and $237 million for the respective periods.\nWe recognized in Interest expense on Long-term debt a net decrease of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net decreases of $256 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These were primarily related to the net settlements including interest accruals on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nA net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. We primarily designate foreign currency derivatives as net investment hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We had notional amounts of approximately $12.5 billion and $12.6 billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were gains of $237 million and $176 million and losses of $253 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net investment hedge reclassifications out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Income were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES\nWe have derivatives that act as economic hedges, but are not designated as such for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign currency transactions from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards. These hedges generally mature within one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of designated currencies at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date.\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. We had notional amounts of approximately $21.7 billion and $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in a net gain of $8 million, a net loss of $21 million and a net gain of $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that are recognized in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn 2022, we recorded an embedded derivative with a notional amount of $78 million, related to seller earnout shares granted to us upon the completion of a business combination between our equity method investee, Global Business Travel Group, and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. This embedded derivative had a fair value of $27 million as of December 31, 2022. The changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative resulted in gains of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which were recognized in Service fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n133\n2020\n(405) 409\n4\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 14\nFAIR VALUES\nFair value is defined as the price that would be required to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability.\nGAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 ― Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access.\n\nLevel 2 ― Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including:\n– Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n– Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\n– Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and\n– Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\nLevel 3 ― Inputs that are unobservable and reflect our own estimates about the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows).\nWe monitor the market conditions and evaluate the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no Level 3 transfers.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE\nThe following table summarizes our financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized by GAAP’s fair value hierarchy (as described in the preceding paragraphs), as of December 31:\n2022\n2021\n(Millions)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nAssets: Investment securities: Equity securities Debt securities Derivatives, gross\n(a)(b)\n(a)\n$\n41 4,537 521\n$\n40 — —\n$\n1 4,490 494\n$\n— 47 27\n$\n79 2,512 590\n$\n78 — —\n$\n1 2,480 590\nTotal Assets\n5,099\n40\n4,985\n74\n3,181\n78\n3,071\nLiabilities: Derivatives, gross\n(a)\n801\n—\n801\n—\n139\n—\n139\nTotal Liabilities\n$\n801\n$\n—\n$\n801\n$\n—\n$\n139\n$\n—\n$\n139\n(a) Refer to Note 4 for the fair values of investment securities and to Note 13 for the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, on a further disaggregated basis.\n(b) Level 3 fair value reflects an embedded derivative.

Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nWhen quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for our investment securities are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by us, and we receive one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services.\nWe reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services by comparing them to alternative pricing sources. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, we evaluate such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on investment securities.\nWithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are our holdings of debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions. We take the carrying value for these investment securities to be a reasonable proxy for their fair value unless we determine, based on our internal credit model, that there are indicators that the contractual cash flows will not be received in full.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of our Level 2 derivative financial instruments is estimated by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from active markets. The pricing models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives as described below. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis.\nThe fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the swap such as the notional amount, fixed coupon rate, floating coupon rate and tenor, as well as discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.\nThe fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the forward contracts such as the notional amount, maturity dates and contract rate, as well as relevant foreign currency forward curves, and discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.\nOur Level 3 derivative financial instrument represents an embedded derivative in the form of seller earnout shares granted to us following the completion of a business combination between our equity method investee, Global Business Travel Group, and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. The fair valuation is performed by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo Simulation technique that models a range of probable future stock prices using the following significant inputs: term of the earnout, initial stock price, annual expected volatility of the common stock over the expected term, annual risk-neutral rate of return over the contractual term and dividend yield, which is further reviewed by management.\nCredit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters, such as a benchmark curve, used to value derivatives are not indicative of our credit quality or that of our counterparties. We consider the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on derivative financial instruments.\n135\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost, and not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and require management’s judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values, nor can the fair value of American Express be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented.\n2022 (Billions)\nCarrying Value\nTotal\nCorresponding Fair Value Amount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nFinancial Assets:\nFinancial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value\nCash and cash equivalents Other financial assets\n(b)\n(a)\n$\n34 60\n$\n34 60\n$\n32 —\n$\n2 60\nFinancial assets carried at other than fair value Card Member and Other loans, less reserves\n(c)\n110\n113\n—\n—\nFinancial Liabilities:\nFinancial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value\n123\n123\n—\n123\nCertificates of deposit Long-term debt\n(c)\n(d)\n$\n16 43\n$\n16 42\n$\n— —\n$\n16 42\n2021 (Billions) Financial Assets:\nCarrying Value\nTotal\nCorresponding Fair Value Amount\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nFinancial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value\nCash and cash equivalents Other financial assets\n(b)\n(a)\n$\n22 56\n$\n22 56\n$\n20 —\n$\n2 56\nFinancial assets carried at other than fair value Card Member and Other loans, less reserves\n(c)\n88\n91\n—\n—\nFinancial Liabilities:\nFinancial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value (d)\nCertificates of deposit Long-term debt\n(c)\n$\n105\n5 39\n$\n105\n5 40\n$\n—\n— —\n$\n105\n5 40\n(a) Level 2 fair value amounts reflect time deposits and short-term investments.\n(b) Balances include Card Member receivables (including fair values of Card Member receivables of $5.2 billion held by a consolidated VIE as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021), other\nreceivables and other miscellaneous assets.\n(c) Balances include amounts held by a consolidated VIE for which the fair values of Card Member loans were $28.4 billion and $26.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and\nthe fair values of Long-term debt were $12.3 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(d) Presented as a component of Customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n136\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLevel 3\n— —\n113\n—\n— —\nLevel 3\n— —\n91\n—\n— —\nTable of Contents\nVALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE\nFor the financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table), we apply the following valuation techniques to measure fair value:\nFinancial Assets For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value\nFinancial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include cash and cash equivalents, Card Member receivables, accrued interest and certain other assets. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate.\nFinancial Assets Carried At Other Than Fair Value\nCard Member and Other loans, less reserves\nCard Member and Other loans are recorded at historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for our loans, we use a discounted cash flow model. Due to the lack of a comparable whole loan sales market for similar loans and the lack of observable pricing inputs thereof, we use various inputs to estimate fair value. Such inputs include projected income, discount rates and forecasted write-offs. The valuation does not include economic value attributable to future receivables generated by the accounts associated with the loans.\nFinancial Liabilities For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value\nFinancial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (excluding certificates of deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products outstanding, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate.\nFinancial Liabilities Carried At Other Than Fair Value\nCertificates of Deposit\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets.\nLong-term Debt\nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values.\n137\nTable of Contents\nWe estimate the Level 3 fair value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values based on price changes as of the date of new similar equity financing transactions completed by the companies in our portfolio. Impairments on such investments are recorded to account for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of an investment based on a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators such as business performance, general market conditions and the economic and regulatory environment. When an impairment triggering event occurs, the fair value measurement is generally derived by taking into account all available information, such as share prices of publicly traded peer companies, internal valuations performed by our investees, and other third-party fair value data. The fair value of impaired investments represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. The carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $0.6 billion represented a nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurement for certain of our equity investments. There were no nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements related to our equity investments without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2021. These amounts are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded unrealized gains of $94 million, $729 million and $113 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unrealized losses representing impairments were $388 million, $2 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Since the adoption of new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities on January 1, 2018, cumulative unrealized gains for equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and cumulative unrealized losses representing impairments were $394 million and $10 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn addition, we also have certain equity investments measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient. Such investments were immaterial as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n138\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15\nGUARANTEES\nThe maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $1 billion and $21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $1 billion and $24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, all of which were primarily related to our real estate arrangements and business dispositions.\nTo date, we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nNOTE 16\nCOMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES\nThe following table shows authorized shares and provides a reconciliation of common shares issued and outstanding for the years ended December 31: (Millions, except where indicated)\n2022\n2021\nCommon shares authorized (billions)\n(a)\n3.6\n3.6\nShares issued and outstanding at beginning of year Repurchases of common shares Other, primarily stock option exercises and restricted stock awards granted\n761 (20) 2\n805 (46) 2\nShares issued and outstanding as of December 31\n743\n761\n(a) Of the common shares authorized but unissued as of December 31, 2022, approximately 18 million shares are reserved for issuance under employee stock and employee benefit plans.\nOn September 23, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions and in accordance with our capital plans. This authorization replaced the prior repurchase authorization and does not have an expiration date. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 20 million common shares with a cost basis of $3.3 billion, 46 million common shares with a cost basis of $7.6 billion, and 7 million common shares with a cost basis of $0.9 billion, respectively. The cost basis includes commissions paid of $4.2 million, $5.6 million and $1.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 36 million common shares remaining under the Board share repurchase authorization.\nCommon shares are generally retired by us upon repurchase (except for 2.4 million shares held as treasury shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2.5 million shares held as treasury shares as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020); retired common shares and treasury shares are excluded from the shares outstanding in the table above. The treasury shares, with a cost basis of $262 million, $271 million and $279 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital in Shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n139\n2020\n3.6\n810 (7) 2\n805\nTable of Contents\nPREFERRED SHARES\nThe Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of up to 20 million preferred shares at a par value of $1.66 per share without further shareholder approval.

We may redeem the outstanding series of preferred shares at $1 million per preferred share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share) plus any declared but unpaid dividends in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest redemption date, or in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of certain bank regulatory changes.\nIn 2021, we paid $1.6 billion to redeem in full the previously outstanding Series B and Series C preferred shares. The difference between the redemption value and carrying value of the redeemed Series B and Series C preferred shares resulted in a $16 million reduction to net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThere were no warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n140\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 17\nCHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nAOCI is a balance sheet item in Shareholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

If not utilized, certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2023 and 2037, whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2030 and 2032.\nA valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances for both periods presented above are associated with certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, state NOLs, and FTC carryforwards.\nAccumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. We do not provide for state income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Accordingly, state income and foreign withholding taxes, which would have aggregated to approximately $0.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, have not been provided on those earnings.\nNet income taxes paid by us during 2022, 2021 and 2020, were approximately $3.0 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. These amounts include estimated tax payments and cash settlements relating to prior tax years.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer’s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, we must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on management’s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management’s best judgment of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We adjust the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome.\nWe are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations.

The prior years’ tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $150 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $118 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period.\nInterest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in the income tax provision. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $10 million, $40 million and $260 million, respectively, in expenses for interest and penalties.\nWe had approximately $380 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n145\n2020\n726\n57 105 —\n(24) (15) (58) (1)\n790\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 21\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS)\nThe computations of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n(Millions, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2021\nNumerator:\nBasic and diluted:\nNet income\nPreferred dividends Equity-related adjustments\n(a)\n$\n7,514 (57) —\n$\n8,060 (71) (16)\nNet income available to common shareholders Earnings allocated to participating share awards\n(b)\n7,457\n(57)\n7,973\n(56)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n7,400\n$\n7,917\nDenominator:\n(b)\nBasic: Weighted-average common stock (c)\nAdd: Weighted-average stock options\n751\n1\n789\n1\nDiluted\n752\n790\nBasic EPS\nDiluted EPS\n$ $\n9.86 9.85\n$ $\n10.04 10.02\n(a) Represents the difference between the redemption value and carrying value of the Series C and Series B preferred shares, which were redeemed on September 15, 2021 and November 15, 2021,\nrespectively.

Our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), is subject to supervision and regulation, including regulatory capital and leverage requirements, by the OCC.\nUnder the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets).\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our operating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we met all capital requirements to which we were subject and maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as well capitalized.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital ratios:\n(Millions, except percentages)\nCET 1 capital\nTier 1 capital\nTotal capital\nCET 1 capital ratio\nTier 1 capital ratio\nTotal capital ratio\nDecember 31, 2022:\n(a)\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n$ $\n20,030 14,820\n$ $\n21,627 14,820\n$ $\n24,926 17,273\n10.3 % 11.3 %\n11.1 % 11.3 %\n12.8 % 13.2 %\nDecember 31, 2021:\n(a)\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n$ $\n17,554 13,085\n$ $\n19,186 13,085\n$ $\n21,506 15,283\n10.5 % 11.8 %\n11.5 % 11.8 %\n12.9 % 13.7 %\nWell-capitalized ratios\n(b)\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\nMinimum capital ratios Effective Minimum\n(d)\n(c)\nN/A 6.5 % 4.5 %\n6.0 % 8.0 % 6.0 %\n10.0 % 10.0 % 8.0 %\nAmerican Express Company American Express National Bank\n7.0 % 7.0 %\n8.5 % 8.5 %\n10.5 % 10.5 %\n(a) Capital ratios reported using Basel III capital definitions and risk-weighted assets using the Basel III standardized approach.\n(b) Represents requirements for bank holding companies and banking subsidiaries to be considered “well capitalized” pursuant to regulations issued under the Federal Reserve Regulation Y and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, respectively.

These restrictions have not had any effect on our shareholder dividend policy and management does not anticipate any impact in the future. Procedures exist to transfer net assets between the Company and its subsidiaries, while ensuring compliance with the various contractual and regulatory constraints. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of net assets of subsidiaries that are restricted to be transferred was approximately $12.0 billion.\n147\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n9.9 % 9.7 %\n10.5 % 10.5 %\nN/A 5.0 % 4.0 %\n4.0 % 4.0 %\nTable of Contents\nBANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends by the Federal Reserve, which could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\nBANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $4.6 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB’s risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n148\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 23\nSIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS\nConcentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to American Express’ total credit exposure. Our customers operate in diverse industries, economic sectors and geographic regions.\nThe following table details our maximum credit exposure of the on-balance sheet assets by category as of December 31: (Billions)\n2022\nIndividuals:\n(a)\nUnited States Outside the United States\n(b)\n$\n156 129 27\n$\nInstitutions:\nFinancial services Other\n(d)\n(c)\nU.S. Government and agencies\n(e)\n36 17 4\nTotal on-balance sheet\n$\n213\n$\n(a)\nPrimarily reflects loans and receivables from global consumer and small business Card Members, which are governed by individual credit risk management.\n(b) The geographic regions with the largest concentration outside the United States include the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Mexico.\n(c) Represents banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and savings and loan associations, which are governed by institutional credit risk management.\n(d) Primarily reflects loans and receivables from global corporate Card Members, which are governed by institutional credit risk management.\n(e) Represent debt obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies, states and municipalities and government-sponsored entities. Risk management for these balances is governed by our Asset\nand Liability Management Committee.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our most significant concentration of credit risk was with individuals. These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, we review each potential customer’s credit application and evaluate the applicant’s financial history and ability and willingness to repay. We also consider credit performance by customer tenure, industry and geographic location in managing credit exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $350 billion and $327 billion, respectively of unused credit, primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements, of which approximately 80 percent was related to customers within the United States in both periods. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit.\n149\n2021\n131 108 23\n24 15 2\n172\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 24 REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS\nWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States), and regulatory environment considerations.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, we updated the methodology used to allocate certain revenues; prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current period presentation.\nEffective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments.\nThe following is a brief description of the primary business activities of our four new reportable operating segments:\n\nU.S. Consumer Services (USCS), which issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products.\n\nCommercial Services (CS), which issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides services to U.S. businesses, including payment and expense management, banking and non-card financing products. CS also issues proprietary corporate cards and provides services to select global corporate clients.\n\nInternational Card Services (ICS), which issues a wide range of proprietary consumer, small business and corporate cards outside the United States. ICS also provides services to our international customers, including travel and lifestyle services, and manages certain international joint ventures and our loyalty coalition businesses.\n\nGlobal Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), which operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers (including our network partnership agreements in China), merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network.\nCorporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other.\n150\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents certain selected financial information for our reportable operating segments and Corporate & Other as of or for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(Millions, except where indicated)\nUSCS\nCS\nICS\nGMNS\nCorporate & Other (a)\n2022 Total non-interest revenues\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nInterest income Interest expense Total revenues net of interest expense Pretax income (loss)\n(b)\n$\n16,440 12,478 8,457 983 23,914 5,400\n$\n12,196 10,844 2,070 697 13,569 2,880\n$\n8,262 5,301 1,453 654 9,061 578\n$\n6,123 5,603 23 (329) 6,475 2,954\n$\n(54) (7) 655 758 (157) (2,227)\n$\nTotal assets (billions)\n$\n94\n$\n51\n$\n37\n$\n20\n$\n26\n$\n2021 Total non-interest revenues\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nInterest income Interest expense Total revenues net of interest expense Pretax income (loss)\n(b)\n$\n12,989 9,823 6,328 395 18,922 5,958\n$\n9,833 8,659 1,408 330 10,911 2,936\n$\n6,761 4,368 1,116 442 7,435 929\n$\n5,021 4,694 16 (92) 5,129 1,874\n$\n26 172 165 208 (17) (1,008)\n$\nTotal assets (billions)\n$\n77\n$\n45\n$\n33\n$\n15\n$\n19\n$\n2020 Total non-interest revenues\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nInterest income Interest expense Total revenues net of interest expense Pretax income (loss)\n(b)\n$\n10,125 7,261 7,009 787 16,347 3,103\n$\n8,210 7,123 1,532 508 9,234 1,013\n$\n5,877 3,663 1,244 379 6,742 521\n$\n4,209 3,948 18 (82) 4,309 1,294\n$\n(319) (21) 280 506 (545) (1,635)\n$\nTotal assets (billions)\n$\n65\n$\n35\n$\n28\n$\n14\n$\n49\n$\n(a) Corporate & Other includes adjustments and eliminations for intersegment activity.\n(b)\nIncludes discount revenue, certain service fees and other revenue and processed revenues from customers.\nTotal Revenues Net of Interest Expense\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, CS and ICS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment’s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue being allocated.\nNet card fees, processed revenue and certain other revenues are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates.\nProvisions for Credit Losses\nThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.\nExpenses\nCard Member rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Business development and Marketing expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue.\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs, which primarily reflect salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, and overhead expenses. Service costs are allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses are allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables.\n151\nConsolidated\n42,967 34,219 12,658 2,763 52,862 9,585\n228\n34,630 27,716 9,033 1,283 42,380 10,689\n189\n28,102 21,974 10,083 2,098 36,087 4,296\n191\nTable of Contents\nGEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents our total revenues net of interest expense and pretax income (loss) from continuing operations in different geographic regions based, in part, upon internal allocations, which necessarily involve management’s judgment.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, we changed the way in which we allocate certain overhead expenses by geographic region.

The Commi\u0000ee shall have all the powers necessary to administer this Plan, including the right to interpret the provisions of this Plan and to establish rules and prescribe any forms for the administra\u0000on of this Plan. The Commi\u0000ee may delegate its authority under this Plan to the Company’s Corporate Secretary (the “Administrator”) to take administra\u0000ve and other speciﬁed ac\u0000ons, subject to such terms and limita\u0000ons as the Commi\u0000ee may impose.\nSec\u0000on 4. Deferral Elec\u0000ons\nA Director may elect for any calendar year to defer receipt of 50% or 100% of the compensa\u0000on payable to the Director for service as a Director or Advisor of the Company and AENB, and including service on Commi\u0000ees of the Boards of Directors thereof.\nA deferral elec\u0000on with respect to the compensa\u0000on earned in a par\u0000cular calendar year shall be made no later than the end of the preceding calendar year; provided, however, to the extent permissible under Sec\u0000on 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the treasury regula\u0000ons and other oﬃcial guidance issued thereunder (collec\u0000vely, “Sec\u0000on 409A”), a Director who is newly elected to the Board of Directors during a calendar year may make an irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on within thirty (30) days a\u0000er his or her elec\u0000on to the Board of Directors, which irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on shall only apply to the Director’s compensa\u0000on earned a\u0000er the date such deferral elec\u0000on became irrevocable. To the extent permissible under Sec\u0000on 409A, the Administrator may permit an individual who has been nominated for elec\u0000on to the Board of Directors of the Company or AENB to make his or her irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on before the date of the individual’s elec\u0000on to such Board of Directors, in which case the elec\u0000on would apply to the Director’s compensa\u0000on earned on and a\u0000er the date on which the individual is elected to such Board of Directors.\n1\nIf the Director’s irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on is received by the Administrator prior to their ini\u0000al elec\u0000on or appointment as a Director, it will be eﬀec\u0000ve subject to and upon their elec\u0000on or appointment as a Director and will apply to compensa\u0000on earned on or a\u0000er the date of their ini\u0000al elec\u0000on or appointment as a Director. If the Director’s irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on is received by the Administrator within 30 days a\u0000er their ini\u0000al elec\u0000on or appointment as a Director, it will be eﬀec\u0000ve upon its receipt and will apply to compensa\u0000on earned a\u0000er the date it is received. If the Director’s irrevocable deferral elec\u0000on is received by the Administrator a\u0000er 30 days following their ini\u0000al elec\u0000on or appointment as a Director (and before January 1 of the following calendar year), it will be eﬀec\u0000ve as of and apply to their compensa\u0000on earned on or a\u0000er January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which they were ini\u0000ally elected or appointed as a Director.\nUnless the Administrator provides otherwise prior to the start of a subsequent calendar year, a Director’s deferral elec\u0000on for a calendar year shall apply to each subsequent calendar year therea\u0000er unless and un\u0000l the Director revokes or changes his or her deferral elec\u0000on prior to the subsequent calendar year.\nSec\u0000on 5. Director Class Year Accounts\nCompensa\u0000on deferred by a Director will be credited to bookkeeping accounts established under this Plan. The compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director a\u0000ributable to calendar years prior to 2015 shall be credited to one account, and the compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director for calendar year 2015 and each calendar year therea\u0000er shall be credited to separate accounts for each such calendar year. For purposes of this Plan, the account established for the compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director a\u0000ributable to calendar years prior to 2015 shall be referred to as the Director’s “Pre-2015 Class Year Account” and the account established for the compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director a\u0000ributable to calendar year 2015 and each calendar year therea\u0000er shall be referred to as the Director’s “Class Year Account” for the respec\u0000ve calendar year (e.g., the account established for the compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director a\u0000ributable to calendar year 2015 shall be referred to as the Director’s “2015 Class Year Account” and the account established for the compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director a\u0000ributable to calendar year 2016 shall be referred to as the Director’s “2016 Class Year Account”). And for purposes of this Plan, the Pre-2015 Class Year Account and each Class Year Account of a Director for a calendar year may be referred to individually as a “Class Year Account,” and collec\u0000vely as the “Class Year Accounts” of the Director.\nThe compensa\u0000on deferred by a Director will be credited to his or her accounts eﬀec\u0000ve as of the last day of the calendar quarter to which such compensa\u0000on relates, except that in the event of the ﬁrst occurrence of a Payment Event Date (as deﬁned in Sec\u0000on 10(a) below) during a calendar quarter for which the Director has deferred all or a por\u0000on of his or her compensa\u0000on, any compensa\u0000on deferred by the Director for the calendar quarter in which such Payment Event Date occurs will be credited to the Director’s account eﬀec\u0000ve as of such Payment Event Date.\nSec\u0000on 6. Investment Op\u0000ons\nAmounts held in a Director’s Class Year Accounts will be credited and debited with earnings and losses based on the hypothe\u0000cal investment op\u0000ons made available by the Company (the “Investment Op\u0000ons”). Unless the Commi\u0000ee provides otherwise, the available Investment Op\u0000ons for a Director’s Class Year Accounts shall be an op\u0000on with credits based on a rate linked to 120% of the applicable federal rate (the “AFR-Based Op\u0000on”) and an op\u0000on linked to the performance of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.20 per share (the “Share Equivalent Op\u0000on”), each as more completely described below.\n2\nAt the \u0000me that a Director makes an elec\u0000on to defer receipt of his or her compensa\u0000on for a calendar year pursuant to Sec\u0000on 4, the Director may choose to have the amounts credited to the Class Year Account for that calendar year allocated in one of the following ways: (i) 100% to the AFR-Based Op\u0000on; (ii) 100% to the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on; or (iii) 50% to the AFR-Based Op\u0000on and 50% to the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on, or among the Investment Op\u0000ons available for such Class Year Account in such propor\u0000ons as allowed by the Commi\u0000ee for such calendar year.\nUnless the Administrator provides otherwise prior to the start of a subsequent calendar year, a Director’s Investment Op\u0000ons elec\u0000on for a calendar year shall apply to each subsequent calendar year therea\u0000er unless and un\u0000l the Director changes his or her Investment Op\u0000ons elec\u0000on prior to such subsequent calendar year.\n(a) AFR-Based Op\u0000on\n(A)\nAmounts for which a Director has chosen the AFR-Based Op\u0000on shall be credited with interest at a rate equal to 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate for December of the preceding calendar year, as prescribed under Sec\u0000on 1274(d) of the Code (the “AFR”) (e.g., amounts that are credited during 2016 shall be credited at a rate equal to the AFR for December 2015). Interest credited pursuant to this Sec\u0000on 6(a) shall be compounded daily, or on such other frequency speciﬁed by the Administrator for such purpose from \u0000me to \u0000me.\n(B)\nFor purposes of Sec\u0000on 10 below, the amounts for which a Director has elected the AFR-Based Op\u0000on that are payable to a Director on a Payment Event Date will be valued by credi\u0000ng such amounts with the AFR through the applicable Payment Event Date.\n(b) Share Equivalent Op\u0000on\n(A)\nAmounts for which a Director has chosen the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on will be converted hypothe\u0000cally into a number of units equivalent to a number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.20 per share (“SEUs”), determined by dividing the amount of deferred compensa\u0000on in each calendar quarter for which the Director has chosen the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on, by the average of the closing prices of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.20 per share (the “Common Stock”), for the last ﬁ\u0000een (15) trading days of such calendar quarter; provided, however, in the event of an occurrence of a Payment Event Date during a calendar quarter, the amounts of the compensa\u0000on deferred by the Director for the calendar quarter in which the Payment Event Date occurs will be converted hypothe\u0000cally into a number of SEUs determined by dividing such amount for which the Director has chosen the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on, by the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the ﬁ\u0000een (15) trading days immediately preceding such Payment Event Date.\n(B)\nOn the date on which the Company pays a dividend on the Common Stock, dividend equivalents in the form of addi\u0000onal SEUs will be credited to a Director’s Class Year Accounts for the number of SEUs equal to (i) the per- share cash dividend, divided by the closing price of the Common Stock on the dividend payment date, mul\u0000plied by (ii) the\n3\nnumber of SEUs credited to each such Class Year Account on the shareholder record date applicable to such dividend payment.\n(C)\nIn the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock by reasons of any stock split, stock dividend, split up, split-oﬀ, spin-oﬀ, recapitaliza\u0000on, merger, consolida\u0000on, rights oﬀering, reorganiza\u0000on, combina\u0000on or exchange of shares, a sale by the Company of all or part of its assets, any distribu\u0000on to the shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, or other extraordinary or unusual event, the number of SEUs credited to a Director’s Class Year Accounts shall be automa\u0000cally adjusted on the same basis so that the propor\u0000onate interest of the Director shall be maintained as before the occurrence of such event.\n(D)\nFor purposes of Sec\u0000on 10 below, the SEUs payable to a Director on a Payment Event Date will be valued by mul\u0000plying the applicable number of SEUs payable by the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the ﬁ\u0000een (15) trading days immediately preceding the applicable Payment Event Date.\nThe Administrator may in his or her discre\u0000on allow a Director to change the Investment Op\u0000ons for an exis\u0000ng Class Year Account at any \u0000me a\u0000er such Director’s separa\u0000on from service, pursuant to such rules and restric\u0000ons as the Administrator may prescribe.\nSec\u0000on 7. Credits to Class Year SEU Award Accounts for SEU Plan Awards\nA number of SEUs equal to the number of Share Equivalent Units, if any, awarded to a Director during a calendar year under the American Express Company 2003 Share Equivalent Unit Plan for Directors, as amended and restated from \u0000me to \u0000me (the “SEU Plan”) for calendar year 2015 and subsequent calendar years, will be credited to a bookkeeping account established under this Plan for such Director for that calendar year. A Director’s SEUs a\u0000ributable to awards of Share Equivalent Units under the SEU Plan for calendar year 2015 and each calendar year therea\u0000er shall be credited to separate accounts for each such calendar year, and such separate account shall be referred to as the Director’s “Class Year SEU Award Account” for the respec\u0000ve calendar year (e.g., the account established for the Director’s SEUs a\u0000ributable to awards of Share Equivalent Units under the SEU Plan for 2015 shall be referred to as the Director’s “2015 Class Year SEU Award Account” and the account established for the Director’s SEUs a\u0000ributable to awards of Share Equivalent Units under the SEU Plan for calendar year 2016 shall be referred to as the Director’s “2016 Class Year SEU Award Account”). And for purposes of this Plan, each Class Year SEU Award Account of a Director for a calendar year may be referred to individually as a “Class Year SEU Award Account,” and collec\u0000vely as the “Class Year SEU Award Accounts” of the Director.\nIf a Director has a Pre-2015 Class Year Account for the compensa\u0000on deferred by the Director a\u0000ributable to calendar years prior to 2015, then the Director’s SEUs a\u0000ributable to awards of Share Equivalent Units under the SEU Plan for calendar years prior to 2015 shall be credited to such exis\u0000ng Pre-2015 Class Year Account and treated as SEUs under the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on, and adjusted and paid accordingly. If a Director does not have a Pre-2015 Class Year Account for the compensa\u0000on deferred by the Director a\u0000ributable to calendar years prior to 2015, then the Director’s SEUs a\u0000ributable to awards of Share Equivalent Units under the SEU Plan for calendar years prior to 2015 shall be credited to a new Pre-2015 Class Year Account and treated as SEUs under the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on.\n4\nThe SEUs to be credited pursuant to this Sec\u0000on 7 for calendar year 2015 and each calendar year therea\u0000er shall be credited to a Class Year SEU Award Account for such calendar year at the \u0000me speciﬁed by the SEU Plan, and therea\u0000er, shall be adjusted, valued and paid in the same manner as the SEUs credited to a Class Year Account under the Share Equivalent Op\u0000on.\nThe Administrator may in his or her discre\u0000on allow a Director to change the Investment Op\u0000ons for an exis\u0000ng Class Year SEU Award Account at any \u0000me a\u0000er such Director’s separa\u0000on from service, pursuant to such rules and restric\u0000ons as the Administrator may prescribe.\nSec\u0000on 8. Payment Elec\u0000ons\n(a) A Director who is newly elected to the Board of Directors of the Company or AENB may make an irrevocable payment elec\u0000on,\nwhich will be applicable to the Director’s Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for the calendar year in which the individual is elected to such Board of Directors, as to the \u0000me and form of payment of such Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account as follows:\n(A) Time of Payment. Either:\ni.\nupon the Director’s separa\u0000on from service; or\nii. on a speciﬁed anniversary following the Director’s separa\u0000on from service, but not later than the tenth (10th)\nanniversary therea\u0000er.\n(B) Form of Payment. In cash, in either:\n(i) a lump sum; or\n(ii) a speciﬁed number of annual installments (not to exceed ten (10)).\nTo the extent permissible under Sec\u0000on 409A, a Director who is newly elected to the Board of Directors of the Company or AENB shall make the payment elec\u0000on provided by this Sec\u0000on 8(a) for his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for the year in which the individual is elected to such Board of Directors, within thirty (30) days a\u0000er his or her elec\u0000on to such Board of Directors (or to the extent permissible under Sec\u0000on 409A, the Administrator may permit an individual who has been nominated for elec\u0000on to the Board of Directors of the Company or AENB during a calendar year to make his or her irrevocable elec\u0000on before the date of the individual’s elec\u0000on to such Board of Directors, applicable if the individual is so elected to such Board of Directors).\nIf a Director does not make a payment elec\u0000on under this Sec\u0000on 8(a) for his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account within the \u0000me permi\u0000ed, or a Director is not permi\u0000ed by Sec\u0000on 409A to make a payment elec\u0000on under this Sec\u0000on 8(a) for such accounts, then the Director will be deemed to have elected to receive such accounts in a lump sum upon such Director’s separa\u0000on from service.\nThe payment elec\u0000on (or default payment elec\u0000on) under this Sec\u0000on 8(a) for a calendar year shall apply to both a Director’s Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for such calendar year.\n(b) For each subsequent calendar year following the calendar year in which a Director is ﬁrst elected to the Board of Directors, the\nDirector may make an irrevocable payment elec\u0000on, which will be applicable to the Director’s Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for such subsequent calendar year, specifying the \u0000me and form of\n5\npayment of such Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account from the op\u0000ons described in Sec\u0000ons 8(a)(A) and (B) above.\nA Director shall make the payment elec\u0000on provided by this Sec\u0000on 8(b) for his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for a subsequent calendar year no later than the end of the preceding calendar year.\nUnless the Administrator provides otherwise prior to the start of a subsequent calendar year, a Director’s actual (or default) payment elec\u0000on for his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for a calendar year shall apply to his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for each subsequent calendar year therea\u0000er unless and un\u0000l the Director makes a new payment elec\u0000on under this Sec\u0000on 8(b) for such Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account prior to the subsequent calendar year.\nThe payment elec\u0000on (or default payment elec\u0000on) under this Sec\u0000on 8(b) for a subsequent calendar year shall apply to both a Director’s Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for such subsequent calendar year.\n(c) A Director may change an exis\u0000ng (or default) payment elec\u0000on in eﬀect for a Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account\nfor a calendar year by making a subsequent payment elec\u0000on, provided that such subsequent payment elec\u0000on:\n(A)\ndoes not take eﬀect for twelve (12) months following the date such subsequent elec\u0000on becomes eﬀec\u0000ve;\n(B)\nspeciﬁes a new permissible payment date (or a new permissible payment commencement date in the case of annual installment payments) that is no sooner than ﬁve years a\u0000er the original payment date (or the original payment commencement date in the case of installment payments); and\n(C)\nthe new payment date (or a new payment commencement date in the case of annual installment payments) is no later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Director’s separa\u0000on from service.\nAny change to a Director’s exis\u0000ng payment elec\u0000on (or default payment elec\u0000on) for a calendar year shall apply to both his or her Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account for such calendar year.\n(d) Upon a Director’s separa\u0000on from service, the Director’s payment elec\u0000on in eﬀect on such date for each of the Director’s Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts shall govern the \u0000me and form of the payment of each Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account, respec\u0000vely, for purposes of Sec\u0000on 10 below.\nSec\u0000on 9. Death Prior to Receipt\nIn the event that a Director dies prior to receipt of any or all of the amounts payable to him or her pursuant to this Plan, except as otherwise provided by this Sec\u0000on 9, any amounts that are then credited to the Director’s Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts shall be paid to the legal representa\u0000ve of the Director’s estate pursuant to Sec\u0000on 10 below.\nThe Administrator may allow Directors to designate a beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries to receive payment of their respec\u0000ve Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts in the event of the Director’s death, and to prescribe the terms of and procedures for any such beneﬁciary designa\u0000ons. In the event\n6\nthat the Administrator allows Directors to make such beneﬁciary designa\u0000ons, then in the event of the death of a Director with a valid beneﬁciary elec\u0000on in place at that \u0000me, amounts that are then credited to such deceased Director’s Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts shall be paid to the designated beneﬁciary or beneﬁciaries of the deceased Director pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of such valid beneﬁciary designa\u0000on (instead of to the legal representa\u0000ve of the Director’s estate). Any payments under this Sec\u0000on 9 shall be paid in a lump sum.\nSec\u0000on 10. Time and Amount of Payment\n(a) Time of Payment. A Director’s Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts will each be paid (or commence to be paid in\nthe case of installment payments) on the Payment Event Date applicable to and in eﬀect for such Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account, as elected by the Director or otherwise provided by this Plan.\nWith respect to each Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account, “Payment Event Date” shall mean the date of the Director’s separa\u0000on from service or the speciﬁed anniversary following the Director’s separa\u0000on from service no later than the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof, whichever is applicable to such Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account pursuant to Sec\u0000on 8 (including Sec\u0000on 8(c)), or if earlier, the date of the Director’s death as provided by Sec\u0000on 9.\nPayment of a Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account shall be made in a lump sum or a speciﬁed number of installments, which is applicable to such Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account pursuant to Sec\u0000on 8 (including Sec\u0000on 8(c)), or if payment is made as a result of the death of a Director, in a lump sum as provided by Sec\u0000on 9.\nIn the case of a Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account payable in installment payments, each anniversary of the ini\u0000al Payment Event Date for such Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account will also be treated as a Payment Event Date.\nA payment to be made on a given Payment Event Date will be made or commenced as soon as administra\u0000vely prac\u0000cable following the Payment Event Date, but no later than 90 days therea\u0000er (or such later date permi\u0000ed by Sec\u0000on 409A).\n(b) Amount of Payment. The amount to be paid for a Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account on a Payment Event Date will\nbe calculated as of the applicable Payment Event Date pursuant to Sec\u0000on 6 above through such applicable Payment Event Date. No interest, dividend equivalents or other earnings will be credited on amounts payable on a given Payment Event Date between such applicable Payment Event Date and the actual date on which such payment is made to or received by the Director.\nIf the Director elects to receive payment of a Class Year Account or a Class Year SEU Award Account in a speciﬁed number of annual installments, each installment will be paid propor\u0000onally, based on the number of remaining installment payments and the balance of the Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account, as applicable, including the related earnings and losses credited and debited to such Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account pursuant to Sec\u0000on 6 and this Sec\u0000on 10. (As an example, if a Director chooses to have an account paid in four annual installments, the payment for the ﬁrst year shall be 1/4 of the value of the account; the payment for the second year shall be 1/3 of the value of the account; the payment for the third year\n7\nshall be 1/2 of the value of the account; and the payment for the fourth year shall be 1/1 of the value of the account.)\nIn the case of a Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account payable in installment payments, the Class Year Account or Class Year SEU Award Account, as applicable, shall be valued as of the Payment Event Date for each installment.\nSec\u0000on 11. Director’s Rights Unsecured\nThe right of any Director to receive future payments under the provisions of this Plan shall be an unsecured, contractual claim against the general assets of the Company. This Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any segrega\u0000on of assets for the payment of any amounts under this Plan.\nPar\u0000cipants may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge, levy, a\u0000ach, encumber or alienate any amounts payable under this Plan.\nSec\u0000on 12. Statement of Account\nThe Company will provide or make available to each Director a statement of account that will conﬁrm the Director’s Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account balance(s) as of the end of the preceding quarter, or on such more frequent basis as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may provide for such statement of accounts to be in wri\u0000ng (including electronic format) or by means of access to such informa\u0000on in electronic format.\nSec\u0000on 13. Amendment\nThis Plan may be amended at any \u0000me and from \u0000me to \u0000me by the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may not adopt any amendment that would (a) materially and adversely aﬀect any right of or beneﬁt to any Director with respect to any of the beneﬁts theretofore credited without such Director’s wri\u0000en consent, or (b) result in a viola\u0000on of Sec\u0000on 409A. Any amendment to this Plan that would cause a viola\u0000on of Sec\u0000on 409A shall be null and void and of no eﬀect.\nSec\u0000on 14. Termina\u0000on\nThis Plan shall terminate upon the adop\u0000on of a resolu\u0000on of the Board of Directors termina\u0000ng this Plan. The termina\u0000on of this Plan shall not aﬀect the distribu\u0000on of the Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts maintained under this Plan, and the balances of each Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account shall con\u0000nue to become due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this Plan in eﬀect immediately prior to the termina\u0000on of this Plan and each Director’s payment elec\u0000on (or default payment elec\u0000on) applicable to such Class Year Account and Class Year SEU Award Account; provided, however, if the Board of Directors so chooses, notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the payment of all Class Year Accounts and Class Year SEU Award Accounts may be accelerated upon the termina\u0000on of this Plan to the extent permissible under and in accordance with Sec\u0000on 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) of the treasury regula\u0000ons.\nSec\u0000on 15. Sec\u0000on 409A\nThis Plan and the beneﬁts provided thereunder, including SEUs credited pursuant to Sec\u0000on 7, are intended to comply with the requirements of Sec\u0000on 409A, and this Plan, and with respect to SEUs credited pursuant to Sec\u0000on 7, together with the SEU Plan, shall be administered and interpreted consistent with such inten\u0000on and the American Express Sec\u0000on 409A Compliance Policy.\n* * * *\n8\nTWELFTH AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT RESTORATION PLAN (formerly known as the Supplemental Retirement Plan)\n(As amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2023)\nEXHIBIT 10.20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nARTICLE 1 HISTORY AND EFFECTIVE DATES\nSection 1.1\nHistory\nSection 1.2\nEffective Date\nSection 1.3\nTransition Rules\nSection 1.4\nModification of Certain Grandfathered Benefits\nARTICLE 2 DEFINITIONS\nSection 2.1\nDefinitions\nSection 2.2\nQualified Plan Definitions\nSection 2.3\nGender and Number\nARTICLE 3 ADMINISTRATION\nSection 3.1\nAdministrator\nSection 3.2\nAuthority\nARTICLE 4 ELIGIBILITY\nSection 4.1\nEligibility\nSection 4.2\nParticipation\nARTICLE 5 SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS\nSection 5.1\nBenefits Under the RP\nSection 5.2\nBenefits in Excess of Limits Under the RSP\nSection 5.3\nCrediting of Account\nSection 5.4\nSupplemental Benefits Payment Election\nARTICLE 6 ELECTIVE DEFERRALS\nSection 6.1\nNotification\nSection 6.2\nParticipation\ni\n1\n1\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n11\n11\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n13\n13\n14\n17\n18\n22\n22\n22\nSection 6.3\nNewly Eligible Employees\nSection 6.4\nDeferrable Compensation\nSection 6.5\nDeferral Benefits Election\nSection 6.6\nCrediting of Deferred Amounts\nARTICLE 7 EARNINGS\nSection 7.1\nRP-Related Account\nSection 7.2\nRSP-Related Account\nSection 7.3\nDeferral Accounts\nSection 7.4\nHypothetical Investment Method\nSection 7.5\nInterest Method\nSection 7.6\nSpecial Restrictions\nARTICLE 8 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\nSection 8.1\nSupplemental Account Payments (Other than Payments Due to Death or Disability)\nSection 8.2\nDeferral Account Payments (Other than Payments Due to Death or Disability)\nSection 8.3\nDesignation of Beneficiaries\nSection 8.4\nDeath\nSection 8.5\nDisability\nSection 8.6\nUnforeseeable Emergency\nSection 8.7\nCompany Offset\nSection 8.8\nWithholding\nSection 8.9\nDe Minimis Lump Sum Payment\nARTICLE 9 CHANGE IN CONTROL\nSection 9.1\nChange in Control\nSection 9.2\nEffect of Change in Control\nARTICLE 10 CLAIMS PROCEDURES\nii\n23\n23\n25\n26\n26\n26\n27\n27\n27\n29\n29\n30\n30\n31\n33\n34\n35\n36\n36\n37\n37\n37\n37\n39\n41\nSection 10.1\nClaim\nSection 10.2\nClaim Decision\nSection 10.3\nRequest for Review\nSection 10.4\nReview of Decision\nSection 10.5\nArbitration\nSection 10.6\nBurden of Proof\nSection 10.7\nAdministrator’s Sole Authority\nARTICLE 11 AMENDMENT & TERMINATION\nSection 11.1\nPlan Amendment\nSection 11.2\nEffect of Plan Termination\nARTICLE 12 GENERAL PROVISIONS\nSection 12.1\nUnfunded Status\nSection 12.2\nNon-Transferable\nSection 12.3\nNo Right to Continued Employment\nSection 12.4\nPlan Benefits Not Compensation Under Employee Benefit Plans\nSection 12.5\nCompliance with Section 409A\nSection 12.6\nNo Guarantee of Tax Consequences\nSection 12.7\nLimitations on Liability\nSection 12.8\nSeverability\nSection 12.9\nCaptions\nSection 12.10\nGoverning Law\niii\n41\n42\n43\n43\n45\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n47\n47\n47\n47\n47\n48\n48\n48\n48\nTWELFTH AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN EXPRESS RETIREMENT RESTORATION PLAN (formerly known as the Supplemental Retirement Plan)\n(As amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2023)\nARTICLE 1 HISTORY AND EFFECTIVE DATES\nSection 1.1 History.\n(a) On November 26, 1973, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of American Express Company (“Amex”) authorized and approved the adoption of the American Express Supplementary Pension Plan (the “Plan”) to supplement retirement benefits provided under the American Express Retirement Plan and other retirement and savings plans sponsored by Amex for a select group of management or highly compensated individuals.\n(b) On July 1, 1994, the Board authorized and directed the amendment and restatement of the Plan pursuant to the provisions of Section VII thereof.

Participation in this Plan shall be limited to Employees who meet the requirements of Section 4.2, and shall automatically occur for such Employees, provided that the Administrator may designate, on a case-by-case basis, Employees or categories of Employees who shall not be eligible to participate in all or any portion of this Plan, and provided further, that the determination of eligible Employees shall be made consistent with the requirement that the Plan be a “top-hat” plan for purposes of ERISA. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Employees must be in Band 35 or above to become eligible to participate in the Plan.\nSection 4.2 Participation. To become a Participant in the Plan, an Employee must satisfy Section 4.1 and:\n(a) be a participant under a Qualified Retirement Plan maintained by the Company. Participation by an Employee in a Qualified Retirement Plan shall be determined pursuant to and in accordance with the eligibility criteria applicable under such Qualified Retirement Plan; and\n(b) for the relevant Plan Year:\n(i) have an Account under the Plan from a prior Plan Year (provided that, solely for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, a Participant who would have had an Account balance had he or she accepted a previous offer to participate in the Plan shall be treated as having an Account balance); or\n(ii) receive Total Pay (as defined under the RSP, without regard to the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation) in\nexcess of the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation; or\n12-\n(iii) be employed in Band 50 or above as of the Band 50 Determination Date in the prior Plan Year (provided that an individual newly hired into or promoted to Band 50 or newly eligible while in Band 50 after the Band 50 Determination Date and not already a Participant eligible for open enrollment may be permitted by the Administrator (in its discretion, and in accordance with such administrative policies as the Administrator may establish) to participate in open enrollment for the coming Plan Year); or\n(iv) accrue benefits under a Qualified Retirement Plan in excess of the Section 415 Limitation.\nARTICLE 5 SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS\nSection 5.1 Benefits Under the RP. If a Participant is a participant under the RP, other than a terminated participant, the\nCompany shall establish an RP-Related Account for such Participant, which shall be determined as follows:\n(a) “Compensation” for RP Credits. For purposes of RP credits under this Section 5.1, “Compensation” has the meaning given such term in the RP, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, designate additional or different items as Compensation for purposes of this Section 5.1. Effective with the 2003 performance year (which awards were granted in 2004) and thereafter, “Compensation” for purposes of RP credits under this Section 5.1 shall include the value of restricted stock awards granted to certain Participants in lieu of cash supplemental Annual Incentive Awards.\n(b) Contribution Credits. There shall be credited to a Participant’s RP-Related Account for each Plan Year, in accordance with Section 5.3, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of: (x) the Contribution Credits that would have been credited to a Participant’s Defined Benefit Account Balance under the RP for the Plan Year if the Plan’s definition of Compensation was used, the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation was ignored, and the Participant had not elected or been required to defer the receipt of any Compensation pursuant to a Deferral Plan, over (y) the actual Contribution Credits credited to the Participant’s Defined Benefit Account Balance under the RP for the Plan Year. No credits shall be made to a Participant’s RP-Related Account pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) for any pay period ending on or after July 1, 2007.\n(c) Benefits Formula. The formula of the benefits for a Plan Year under this Section 5.1 shall be determined by the\nAdministrator and applied in a uniform manner for all similarly situated Participants.\n(d) Additional Years of Service.\n(i) Certain Participants, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, may be deemed to have rendered five additional Years of Service under the Plan. For each such Participant, subject to such terms and conditions as the Company may impose upon such benefits by special agreement with such Participant (in the event of a conflict with this Section 5.1(d), such special agreement shall control), an additional amount shall be credited to the Participant’s RP-Related Account equal to the excess, if any of: (x) the total cumulative Contribution Credits that would have been credited to the Participant’s RP- Related Account under this Section 5.1 had the Participant rendered such additional Years of Service under the\n13-\nRP, over (y) the actual total cumulative Contribution Credits credited to the Participant’s RP-Related Account under this Section 5.1 as of the date the Participant is eligible for such benefits under the Plan. Subject to the terms of the special agreement with each such Participant, such amounts shall be calculated and credited to the RP-Related Account established for the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3 under procedures to be determined from time to time by the Administrator and consistently applied to similarly situated Participants. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or agreed in a special agreement with the Participant, amounts credited under this Section 5.1(d) shall be subject to five-year vesting, and such amounts shall be forfeited by the Participant if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason other than death or disability (as defined in the RP) before five years of actual service have been rendered to the Company by such Participant.\n(ii) For each Participant with a special agreement described in Section 5.1(d)(i) who has not accrued five Years of Service as of July 1, 2007, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the credit described in Section 5.1(d)(i) for the 2007 Plan Year as if the RP had remained in effect through December 31, 2007, and the Participant were an active participant in the RP through such date. Regardless of any special agreement described in Section 5.1(d)(i), a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any credit under this Section 5.1 for the 2008 Plan Year or later.\nSection 5.2 Benefits in Excess of Limits Under the RSP. If a Participant is a participant in the RSP, other than a terminated participant, the Company shall establish an RSP-Related Account for such Participant, which shall be determined as follows:\n(a) “Compensation” for RSP Credits.\n(i) Definition. For purposes of RSP credits under this Section 5.2, “Compensation” has the meaning given the term “Total Pay” in the RSP, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, designate additional or different items as Compensation for purposes of this Section 5.2. Effective July 1, 2007, “Compensation” for purposes of RSP credits under this Section 5.2 shall include the value of restricted stock awards granted to certain Participants in lieu of cash Annual Incentive Awards, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5.2(a)(ii).\n(ii) Limitation. “Compensation” of a Participant who is in Band 50 or above for purposes of RSP credits under this Section 5.2 shall not include any Incentive Pay (including the value of any restricted stock awards granted to certain Participants in lieu of cash Annual Incentive Awards) in excess of one times his or her Base Salary. For purposes of this provision, a Participant’s pay band and Base Salary shall be determined as of January 1 of each Plan Year (or, if the Participant was not employed as an Eligible Employee on January 1, the date the Participant becomes or is rehired as an Eligible Employee, and in the case of a Participant who terminates employment and is rehired as an Eligible Employee within the same Plan Year, the application of this rule shall be determined by pay band as of the date of rehire as an Eligible Employee with respect to Company contributions other than those accrued (and as to which the Participant had met all the prerequisites for receipt) prior to rehire). In addition, Incentive Pay subject to this limitation shall only be those amounts actually paid in the Plan Year, regardless of when such amounts were earned.\n14-\n(iii) Temporary Salary Reductions Disregarded. In determining the Compensation of a Participant for purposes of this Section 5.2, “Total Pay” under the RSP shall be determined by disregarding the temporary salary reductions in effect for the pay period commencing March 30, 2009 through the pay period ending on January 3, 2010.\n(b) Contribution Credits. The following amounts shall be credited to the Participant’s RSP-Related Account for each\nPlan Year, in accordance with Section 5.3:\n(i) Company Stock Contribution. An amount equal to: (A) one percent of the sum of: (1) the Participant’s Compensation, calculated without the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation or Section 415 Limitations, plus (2) that portion of a Participant’s Compensation deferred during such Plan Year pursuant to a Deferral Plan, minus (B) the amount actually allocated as a Company Stock Contribution to the account of the Participant under the RSP. For purposes of this Section 5.2(b)(i), the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation shall be deemed to apply pro ratably to each regularly scheduled pay period for each Plan Year. No credits shall be made to a Participant’s RSP-Related Account pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(i) for any pay period ending on or after July 1, 2007.\n(ii) Company Profit-Sharing Contribution. An amount equal to: (A) the Company Profit-Sharing Contribution percentage utilized for purposes of the RSP for that Plan Year for such Participant (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the percentage utilized for any Company Discretionary Profit Sharing Contribution and/or Company Fixed Rate Contribution, as applicable) times the sum of: (1) the Participant’s Compensation, calculated without the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation or Section 415 Limitations, plus (2) that portion of a Participant’s Compensation deferred during such Plan Year pursuant to a Deferral Plan, minus (B) the amount actually allocated as a Company Profit-Sharing Contribution (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the amount actually allocated as a Company Discretionary Profit Sharing Contribution and/or Company Fixed Rate Contribution, as applicable) to the Account of the Participant under the RSP. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, benefits credited under this Section 5.2(b)(ii) at the time of a Supplemental Distribution shall be restricted to a Participant’s vested portion, as determined under the applicable provisions of the RSP. Any non-vested portion of such deferred compensation to be paid shall be forfeited.\n(iii) Company Matching Contribution.\n(A) Effective with Compensation paid on or after January 1, 2017, each eligible Participant who meets the eligibility requirements for a Qualified Matching Contribution (or other type of matching contribution) under the RSP (but without regard to whether or not he or she contributes under the RSP) shall receive a Matching Contribution each Plan Year equal to the Participant’s salary reduction amount (from Base Salary, Incentive Pay or a combination of both) contributed pursuant to a Deferral Election under Article 6 for such Plan Year (up to a maximum of six percent of the Participant’s Compensation which is not counted under the RSP either because it is in excess of the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation for the Plan Year or because it has been deferred under a Deferral Plan). Compensation for this purpose will not include amounts paid prior to a Participant’s Entry Date under the RSP with respect to Qualified Matching Contributions (or other type of matching contributions, as applicable).\n15-\n(B) Separately from any Matching Contribution calculated under (A), a Participant will be provided a Matching Contribution equal to the amount of Qualified Matching Contribution (or other type of matching contribution) that would have been provided to the Participant under the RSP, but was not able to be provided solely on account of the limitations of Section 415 of the Code.\n(C) The vesting of Matching Contributions will parallel the vesting rules applicable under the RSP.\n(iv) Company Conversion Contribution.\n(A) Except as otherwise provided by Section 5.2(b)(iv)(B), an amount equal to: (1) the Company Conversion Contribution percentage utilized for purposes of the RSP for that Plan Year for such Participant times the sum of: (a) the Participant’s Compensation, calculated without the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation or Section 415 Limitations, plus (b) that portion of a Participant’s Compensation deferred during such Plan Year pursuant to a Deferral Plan, minus (2) the amount actually allocated as a Company Conversion Contribution to the Account of the Participant under the RSP. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, benefits credited under this Section 5.2(b)(iv)(A) at the time of a Supplemental Distribution shall be restricted to a Participant’s vested portion, as determined under the applicable provisions of the RSP. Any non-vested portion of such deferred compensation to be paid shall be forfeited. Pursuant to the terms of the RSP, no Company Conversion Contributions are made for periods after December 31, 2017 for employees in Band 50 and above, or for periods after December 31, 2018 for employees below Band 50; accordingly, no Company Conversion Contributions are made under the Plan for such periods.\n(B) No Company conversion contributions were made for the pay period commencing March 30, 2009 through the pay period ending January 3, 2010 to any Participant; provided, however, the preceding limitation did not apply to Participants who were Retirement Eligible as of December 31, 2009. For the avoidance of doubt, when Company conversion contributions resumed after the pay period ending on January 3, 2010, such contributions resumed in the same amount as in effect immediately prior to the pay period beginning on March 30, 2009; provided, however, that the Company continued to retain the right to modify, amend or terminate the Plan and any contributions thereunder at any time for any reason whatsoever.\n(v) Transition Contributions for Certain Former GE Capital Employees. For Former GE Employees, an amount equal to: (A) the Transition Contribution percentage utilized for purposes of the RSP for that Plan Year for such Participant times the sum of: (1) the Participant’s Compensation, calculated without the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation or Section 415 Limitations, plus (2) that portion of a Participant’s Compensation deferred during such Plan Year pursuant to a Deferral Plan, minus (B) the amount actually allocated as a Transition Contribution to the Account of the Participant under the RSP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an individual would be eligible for both Company Conversion Contributions under Section 5.2(b)(iv) and Transition Contributions under this Section 5.2(b)(v), such individual shall only receive the greater of the Company Conversion Contributions and the Transition Contributions to which he or she would otherwise be entitled during such period of dual eligibility. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, benefits credited under this\n16-\nSection 5.2(b)(v) at the time of a Supplemental Distribution shall be restricted to a Participant’s vested portion, as determined under the applicable provisions of the RSP. Any non-vested portion of such deferred compensation to be paid shall be forfeited. The right to Transition Contributions under this Section shall expire at the same time as the right to Transition Contributions under the RSP. Pursuant to the terms of the RSP, no Transition Contributions are made for periods after March 31, 2011.\n(vi) No Disability Contributions. The RSP provides for certain contributions to be made on account of qualifying RSP participants who are “disabled” as defined under the RSP. For the avoidance of doubt, this Plan does not provide for such continuing contributions on account of a disability.\n(c) Company Contribution for Additional Years of Service. Certain Participants, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, may be deemed to have rendered five additional Years of Service under the RSP. For each such Participant, for the period of January 1, 2008 and thereafter, subject to such terms and conditions as the Company may impose upon such benefits by special agreement with such Participant (in the event of a conflict with this Section 5.2(c), such special agreement shall control), an additional amount shall be credited to the Participant’s RSP-Related Account equal to 80 percent (or such lower percentage specified in the special agreement) of the Participant’s annual rate of base salary (as of the Participant’s date of hire), before any reduction for any amounts deferred by the Participant pursuant to Section 401(k) or Section 125 of the Code, or pursuant to a Deferral Plan or any other non-qualified plan which permits the voluntary deferral of compensation. Subject to the terms of the special agreement with each such Participant, such amounts shall be calculated under procedures to be determined from time to time by the Administrator and consistently applied to similarly situated Participants. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or agreed in the special agreement with the Participant, amounts credited under this Section 5.2(c) shall be subject to five-year vesting, and such amounts shall be forfeited by the Participant if the Participant’s service with the Company terminates for any reason other than death or disability (as defined in the RSP) before five years of actual service have been rendered to the Company by such Participant. Amounts described in this Section 5.2(c) shall be credited to the RSP-Related Account established for the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3.\nSection 5.3 Crediting of Account.\n(a) Time and Manner. Amounts described in this Article 5 shall be credited to the Supplemental Account established for a Participant at such times and in such manner as may be determined by the Administrator. In making such credits, the Administrator shall generally attempt to, but shall not be required to, credit accounts at a time and in a manner as similar as possible to the time and manner for the crediting of similar amounts under the Qualified Retirement Plans; provided, however, that:\n(i) unless the Administrator determines otherwise, amounts credited to a Supplemental Account with respect to the application of the Section 415 Limitations to the RP shall be estimated by the Administrator at the time of a Participant’s Separation from Service, based on such assumptions as the Administrator may reasonably impose and consistently applied to similarly situated Participants, and assuming that the Participant would begin receiving\n17-\nbenefits under the RP at the time of the Participant’s Separation from Service, or if later, at the earliest possible date that the Participant could start to receive benefits under the RP, and such estimated amount shall be credited immediately preceding the date upon which the Participant will receive (or commence receiving, in the case of installment payments) payment of benefits under the Plan; and\n(ii) unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or agreed in a special agreement with a Participant, amounts credited to a Supplemental Account pursuant to Section 5.2(c) shall be determined as of and credited on the one-year anniversary of the later of the date of the special agreement or the first day of the Participant’s employment by the Company. The Administrator shall apply such procedures consistently to similarly situated Participants.\n(b) Company Stock Contributions. Amounts described in Section 5.2(b)(i) shall be initially credited to the RSP- Related Account established for a Participant, to a subaccount relating to the Stock Fund. For purposes of the Plan, the amount of such credits shall be determined by the Administrator in a manner determined by the Administrator to be reasonably consistent with similar determinations made under the Stock Fund.\n(c) Other Contributions. Amounts described in Section 5.2(b)(ii) (profit-sharing contributions), Section 5.2(b)(iii) (matching contributions), Section 5.2(b)(iv) (conversion contributions), Section 5.2(b)(v) (GE Capital transition contributions) and Section 5.2(c) (special agreement credits) shall be credited to the RSP-Related Account established for a Participant, which shall contain various subaccounts selected by the Administrator in its sole and exclusive discretion, representing the various investment funds available to a Participant under the RSP as provided for in the Plan; provided that:\n(i) amounts may not be directed to the Stock Fund in excess of limits established by the Plan or Administrator pursuant to Article 7, and any amounts directed to the Stock Fund in excess of those limits will be redirected in accordance with Article 7; and\n(ii) unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, no subaccount shall be established under the Plan to\ncoincide with any self-directed brokerage account which may be available under the RSP.\n(d) Additional Accounts. The Administrator may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, establish additional book reserve accounts from time to time. The procedures to reflect and credit increases, decreases, interest, dividends, and other income, gains and losses shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole and exclusive discretion.\nSection 5.4 Supplemental Benefits Payment Election. Any Supplemental Benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid in\ncash from the general assets of the Company in the form elected by the Participant subject to the following:\n(a) In accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the Administrator in compliance with Section 409A, existing Participants, including Participants (other than those in pay status on December 31, 2004) under the Prior SRP Plan, may make Supplemental Elections as follows:\n18-\n(i) Participants who have not previously made an initial Supplemental Election under Section 5.4(b), whether under the Plan or under the Prior SRP Plan, may make such an initial Supplemental Election on or before the date set by the Administrator, which shall not be later than December 31, 2005.\n(ii) Participants who have previously made an initial Supplemental Election under Section 5.4(b), whether under the Plan or under the Prior SRP Plan, but who have not previously modified such election under Section 5.4(d), whether under the Plan or under the Prior SRP Plan, may change such Supplemental Election on or before the date set by the Administrator, which shall not be later than December 31, 2005, to elect any payment form permissible under Section 5.4(b) and Section 409A, regardless of whether such Supplemental Election lengthens or shortens the period over which payments from the Plan shall be made. For the avoidance of doubt, any such distribution which accelerates payments from the Plan shall not cause any reduction in the amounts otherwise payable hereunder. Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), if made on or before December 31, 2005 in accordance with this Section 5.4(a)(ii), such subsequent Supplemental Election shall be made in accordance with Section 409A, but, to the extent permitted under Section 409A transition guidance, need not comply with the requirement regarding a minimum additional deferral period of five years. Any such subsequent Supplemental Election made under this Section 5.4(a)(ii) shall constitute a modification for purposes of the one-time limitation contained in Section 5.4(d), and no additional modification will thereafter be permitted under Section 5.4(d).\n(iii) Employees who first become Participants after December 31, 2005 may make an initial Supplemental Election in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the Administrator in compliance with Section 409A, which, with respect to Employees who first become Participants on or after January 1, 2012 and individuals who first become entitled to Supplemental Benefits as a result of Compensation paid during the fourth quarter of 2011 (by way of clarification, it is intended that individuals included in an enrollment process attributable to the third quarter of 2011 or an earlier quarter will not be covered by this rule, regardless of whether such individuals filed elections regarding Deferral Benefits and/or Supplemental Benefits at that time or instead were made subject to a default election), shall be applied as follows:\n(A) A Participant’s initial Supplemental Election shall not be effective with respect to Company\ncontributions described in the following paragraphs:\n(i) In the case of a Participant who first receives Compensation with respect to which Company contributions are credited under this Plan for the first, second or third quarter of the calendar year, or in the case of a new Participant in Band 50 or above, whose 30 day election period under Article 6 (or open enrollment period offered in lieu of a special enrollment period) expires no later than December 31 of the Participant’s first calendar year as a Band 50 Employee eligible to participate in this Plan, or in the case of a new Participant who is not in Band 50 or above, who is permitted to file an election during open enrollment under Article 6 for the following calendar year, such Participant’s initial Supplemental Election shall not be effective with respect to Company contributions calculated based on Compensation paid prior to the end of the first calendar year beginning on or after the date on which the Participant first is paid Compensation with respect to which Company\nst\n19-\ncontributions under this Plan are calculated, or in which the Participant is otherwise described in this paragraph.\n(ii) In the case of a Participant who first is paid Compensation with respect to which Company contributions are calculated for the fourth quarter of a calendar year or who in the case of a new Participant in Band 50 or above, has a 30 day election period under Article 6 expiring later than December 31st of the Participant’s first calendar year as a Band 50 Employee eligible to participate in this Plan and is not enrolled via the annual enrollment process in lieu of special enrollment, or in the case of a new Participant who is not in Band 50 or above, who is not permitted to participate in open enrollment under Article 6 for the following calendar year, such Participant’s initial Supplemental Election shall not be effective with respect to Company contributions calculated based on Compensation paid prior to the end of the second calendar year beginning on or after the date the Participant is first paid Compensation with respect to which Company contributions are calculated, or in which the Participant is otherwise described in this paragraph.\n(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, solely for the purposes of determining which Supplemental Benefits are subject to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election, a Participant with Compensation with respect to which Supplemental Benefits could be calculated is considered for purposes of this subsection to have such Supplemental Benefits calculated, regardless of whether the Participant actually qualifies for such Supplemental Benefits to be credited to the Participant’s Account. For example, a Participant’s failure to satisfy the service requirement or make contributions required to receive Company Matching Contributions, or the Company’s decision not to make contributions, shall not impact the duration of the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election.\n(B) Instead, with respect to Company contributions not covered by the Participant’s Supplemental Election, the Company shall be deemed to have made an Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election for the Participant (or his or her beneficiary, in the event of the Participant’s death) to receive his or her Supplemental Benefits attributable to such contributions in the form of a single lump sum as of the January 1 or July 1 that is at least six months following the earliest of his or her Separation from Service or the date of Disability or death, as applicable (or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter, but in any event no later than 90 days).\n(C) Company contributions that are not subject to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election by reason of being calculated with respect to Compensation paid later than the time periods set forth in Section 5.4(a)(iii) (A) above shall be subject to a Participant’s initial Supplemental Election.\n(D) With respect to an Employee who was a former Participant and again becomes a Participant after being rehired by the Company following his or her Separation from Service, the election rules in this Section shall apply to the Company Matching Contributions, Company Conversion Contributions and Company Profit-Sharing Contributions made to such Participant following his or her rehire date as if the rehire date (or if later, the resumption of eligibility to participate) were the date of initial participation eligibility.\n20-\n(iv) Participants who have previously made both a Supplemental Election and a modification to such Supplemental Election shall be subject to the rules of Section 5.4(d) prohibiting any further changes to their Supplemental Elections. However, any Participant who was not in pay status (as defined in Section 1.1(c)) on January 1, 2005 and who previously made a modification to an initial Supplemental Election which accelerated the time period for payments from the Plan shall not have any reduction in the amounts otherwise payable hereunder (notwithstanding Section V(D)(1)(b)(ii) of the Prior SRP Plan).\n(b) A Participant may elect to receive his or her Supplemental Benefits that are not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election in a single lump-sum payment or in annual installments payable over a period of five, ten or 15 consecutive calendar years. Except as provided in Section 5.4(d), a Participant may not modify his or her initial Supplemental Election described in the preceding sentence. Such subsequent Supplemental Election shall apply to the payment of all Supplemental Benefits under the Plan and the Prior SRP Plan that are not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election (except for benefits that were in pay status on December 31, 2004). A Participant’s reemployment after Separation from Service shall not affect benefits attributable to periods prior to his or her Separation from Service, and he or she shall be subject to a new Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election and initial Supplemental Election with respect to post-reemployment benefits.\n(c) If a Participant fails to make a valid, timely Supplemental Election in accordance with Section 5.4(a) and the rules and procedures adopted by the Administrator, such Participant shall be deemed to have made an initial Supplemental Election to receive his or her Supplemental Benefits that are not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election in the form of a single lump sum as of the January 1 or July 1 that is at least six months following the earliest of his or her Separation from Service or the date of Disability or death, as applicable (or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter, but in any event no later than 90 days).\n(d) A Participant who has not previously modified an initial Supplemental Election may make a one-time modification to his or her initial Supplemental Election to elect a different form of payment for Supplemental Benefits under the Plan that are not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election. To be effective, such a modification shall be made by filing a written notice of modification in such form and manner as the Administrator may prescribe; provided, however, that the modification must comply with Section 409A, including the requirements regarding: (i) a minimum additional deferral period of five years, and (ii) the subsequent Supplemental Election not being effective until 12 months after it is made. A Participant may not change the payment method of his or her Supplemental Benefits after his or her Separation from Service. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, with respect to an Employee who was a former Participant and again becomes a Participant after being rehired by the Company following his or her Separation from Service, the one-time modification under this Section 5.4(d) shall be permitted with respect to such Participant’s initial Supplemental Election made following his or her rehire date, regardless of whether the Participant had also made such a modification for benefits earned prior to Separation from Service. By way of clarification, the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election cannot be modified.\n21-\nARTICLE 6 ELECTIVE DEFERRALS\nSection 6.1 Notification. Employees eligible to participate in the Plan for a Plan Year with respect to Deferral Benefits will be notified by Amex of their eligibility to participate for such Plan Year. If Amex erroneously notifies an individual of his or her eligibility to participate, and such individual does not meet the requirements of Section 4.2 or such individual has been excluded by the Administrator pursuant to Section 4.1, such erroneous notification shall not cause the individual to be eligible, and any Deferral Election made by such ineligible individual shall be null and void and of no effect to the extent permissible under Section 409A.\nSection 6.2 Participation. An eligible Employee for a Plan Year who was a Participant in the prior Plan Year as of the Band 50 Determination Date, or who is employed in Band 50 or above as of the Band 50 Determination Date in the prior Plan Year, or who otherwise becomes employed in Band 50 or above or first becomes eligible while in Band 50 or above prior to the end of the prior Plan Year and is authorized by the Administrator to participate in enrollment shall become a Participant in the Plan with respect to Deferral Benefits for such Plan Year by making a Deferral Election in accordance with Section 6.5 for the Plan Year. Such an Employee’s Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date for the Plan Year shall be January 1. In addition to the foregoing, the following special rules apply to the extent permitted by Section 6.3:\n(a) In the case of an Employee who is not already a Participant in the Plan, the Employee shall be considered eligible to participate as of the date he or she first is employed in Band 50 or above (or, in the case of an employee who was in Band 50 or above but not eligible for a Qualified Retirement Plan, as of the date the Employee (while still in Band 50 or above) becomes eligible for a Qualified Retirement Plan) and shall be permitted to file an election within 30 days of such date. Such Employee’s Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date shall be the first payroll period beginning after the expiration of the 30-day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may establish procedures regarding coordination of special enrollment and open enrollment opportunities for Employees who would otherwise become eligible for Band 50 or above special enrollment at the end of the Plan Year, and/or may otherwise impose limits on the availability of special enrollment in appropriate circumstances.\n(b) In the case of an Employee who is not already a Participant in the Plan and is not employed in Band 50 or\nabove, the following rules shall apply:\n(i) An Employee who was not otherwise eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year and first satisfies the requirements for participation during one of the first three quarters of the Plan Year by reason of exceeding the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation will become eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits under the Plan effective January 1 of the following Plan Year, which shall be such Employee’s Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date, and may participate in the Plan’s open enrollment period.\n(ii) An Employee who was not otherwise eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year and first satisfied the requirements for participation during the final calendar quarter of the Plan Year by reason of exceeding the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation will become eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits under the Plan as of the first pay period beginning after the first day of the second month of the first calendar quarter of the following\n22-\nPlan Year (the first day of such pay period being the Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date), and may make an election in advance of such date and in accordance with Section 6.3 by the deadline established by the Administrator.\n(iii) By way of clarification, an Employee does not have a special enrollment right merely because he or\nshe exceeds the Section 415 limit under a Qualified Retirement Plan.\n(iv) By way of clarification, the date an Employee exceeds the Section 401(a)(17) Limit is determined based on Compensation for the Plan Year, regardless of whether some portion of that Compensation is excluded from Supplemental Benefits calculations because the Participant had not yet completed the service requirement for Company contributions.\n(c) Except as expressly permitted under this Section, mid-year elections are not allowed. A mid-year election may not be made, even if otherwise permitted under this Section, unless the Employee also satisfies all the requirements of Section 6.3, and must be filed by the deadline established by the Administrator. All Deferral Elections will become irrevocable as of the day before the Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date, or such earlier date as is established by the Administrator.\nSection 6.3 Newly Eligible Employees. To the extent permissible under Section 409A and Section 6.2, Employees who become eligible to participate in the Plan during a Plan Year with respect to Deferral Benefits and who have not previously been eligible to participate in an elective account-balance deferred compensation arrangement (as defined for purposes of Section 409A) of Amex or its subsidiaries may be offered by Amex the opportunity to participate in the Plan for the Plan Year in accordance with Section 6.2. In the case of an Employee who had previously been eligible to participate in an elective account-balance deferred compensation arrangement (as defined for purposes of Section 409A) of Amex or its subsidiaries (regardless of whether he or she chose to do so), that Employee may be treated as newly eligible to participate and entitled to mid-year enrollment to the extent permitted by Section 6.2 if:\n(a) The Employee had received payment of all amounts under the Plan’s Deferral Account and any other elective account-balance plan and, as of the date of the last payment was not eligible to continue participation in the Plan’s Deferral Benefits or any other elective account-balance plan, disregarding for this purpose any right to delay payment; or\n(b) The Employee had ceased to be eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits under the Plan and all other elective account-balance plans and had not been eligible to participate in Deferral Benefits under the Plan or any other elective account- balance plan at any time during the 24-month period ending on the date the Employee again became eligible (disregarding for purposes of determining the Employee’s eligibility the right to accrue earnings on amounts in the Plan or other elective account- balance plan), regardless of whether the Employee has received payments of amounts previously deferred.\nSection 6.4 Deferrable Compensation.\n(a) Eligible Compensation.\n23-\n(i) An eligible Employee for a Plan Year may elect to defer a specified amount from one or more of the\nfollowing items:\n(A) the Employee’s Base Salary to be paid during that Plan Year; and\n(B) the Employee’s Incentive Pay to be paid in the second Plan Year to commence after the election is made (excluding any amounts that would otherwise be Incentive Pay but which are earned prior to the start of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Deferral Election is filed).\n(ii) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a)(i), an Employee who becomes eligible to participate in the Plan with respect to Deferral Benefits during a Plan Year who is offered the opportunity by Amex to participate as described in Section 6.3 may only elect to defer a specified amount from one or more of the following items:\n(A) the Employee’s Base Salary for the Plan Year of the Deferral Election which is paid for payroll\nperiods beginning on and after the Employee’s Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date; and\n(B) a portion of the Employee’s Incentive Pay to be paid in the following Plan Year, calculated by multiplying the amount of each Incentive Pay payment made in the following Plan Year by a percentage, such percentage to be determined by dividing the number of days remaining in the calendar year as of the Employee’s Deferral Benefits Eligibility Date by 365 or, in the case of an Employee hired during the performance period, by the total number of days in the performance period measured from the date of hire.\n(b) Maximum Deferral. The Administrator shall impose the following limits on Deferral Benefits, provided that the Administrator (in its sole discretion) may waive an otherwise applicable limit so long as such waiver is approved no later than the day before the date a Deferral Election becomes effective.\n(i) The Administrator shall limit the amount that may be deferred from (A) Base Salary to be paid in the following Plan Year and (B) Incentive Pay to be paid in the second following Plan Year, to 100 percent of the Participant’s Base Salary rate in effect as of the December 31st of the Plan Year during which the Deferral Election is filed (or with respect to an Employee who becomes eligible to participate in the Plan with respect to Deferral Benefits during a Plan Year, shall limit the amount that may be deferred from Base Salary paid in such Plan Year and Incentive Pay paid in the following Plan Year (1) if the Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Plan by reason of being hired into or a promotion to Band 50 or above (or a transfer to eligible status while in Band 50), 100 percent of the Employee’s Base Salary rate in effect as of the date he or she becomes eligible to so participate; (2) if the Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Plan by reason of exceeding the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation, 100 percent of the Employee’s Base Salary rate in effect as of the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the date he or she becomes eligible to so participate pursuant to Section 6.2(b)). The Administrator shall calculate this limit by (X) subtracting the percentage of Base Salary elected to be deferred from 100 percent, (Y) multiplying the Base Salary rate times the percentage obtained under clause (X), and (Z) limiting the Incentive Pay Deferral Benefits for the second following (or, in the case, of mid-year enrollment, the\n24-\nfollowing) Plan Year to the dollar amount obtained under clause (Y). By way of clarification, a Participant’s actual Base Salary Deferral Benefits will vary in amount, depending on actual Base Salary paid, but shall not affect this maximum limit on Incentive Pay in the second following (or in the case of mid-year enrollment, the following) Plan Year.\n(ii) All Deferral Elections shall be limited to the amount of any payment otherwise payable in cash, net of\napplicable withholdings.\n(iii) The Administrator may, in its discretion, impose further limits on the amount or percentage that can be deferred from Base Salary and/or Incentive Pay for a given Plan Year. Any such limit will be imposed no later than the day before the date the Deferral Election takes effect. Unless and until the Administrator decides otherwise, the maximum percentage of Incentive Pay that may be elected is 85 percent.\n(c) Computation of Deferral Amounts. The Administrator may specify that Deferral Elections must be made as a percentage of Base Salary and Incentive Pay, respectively, as a dollar amount of Base Salary and Incentive Pay, respectively, or in some other reasonable fashion. The Administrator may permit the use of multiple methods of calculating Deferral Elections or require use of a single method. The Administrator may permit Employees to specify that a Deferral Election shall apply only to the extent that the Employee is paid amounts in excess of the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation.\nSection 6.5 Deferral Benefits Election.\n(a) Time of Deferral Election. An eligible Employee for a Plan Year who wants to participate in the Plan with respect to Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year must make an irrevocable Deferral Election for the Plan Year on or before the December 15 of the preceding Plan Year, or if December 15 is on a weekend, the following Monday, or as of such other deadline as the Administrator may establish (but in all events prior to the beginning of such Plan Year); provided, however, that an Employee permitted under Section 6.2 to make a mid-year Deferral Election for the Plan Year in which he or she becomes eligible to participate may make a Deferral Election by the deadline established under that Section (or by such earlier deadline as may be established by the Administrator).\n(b) Form of Deferral Election. A Deferral Election for a Plan Year shall be made in the manner and by the deadlines\nprescribed by the Administrator.\n(c) Contents of Deferral Election. In his or her Deferral Election for a Plan Year, the Employee shall specify:\n(i) the items of his or her compensation eligible for deferral under Section 6.4(a) that the Employee wishes to defer for the Plan Year and the amount of each such item to be deferred, provided that the amount of all items to be deferred complies with Section 6.4(b) and any administrative limits imposed on elections made for such Plan Year;\n(ii) in the case of an Employee in Band 50 or above as of the Band 50 Determination Date in the prior Plan Year (or a non-Participant who first becomes an eligible Band 50 Employee after such date and is permitted by the Administrator to participate in open enrollment for the following Plan Year on account of such hire or promotion into Band 50):\n25-\n(A) the time when his or her Deferral Benefits for such Plan Year shall be paid, which shall be either (A) the Separation from Service of the Participant, or (B) a specified date at least five years after the last day of the Plan Year at the time of the election; and\n(B) the form of payment of his or her Deferral Benefits for the Plan Year, which shall be (A) a lump\nsum, or (B) five, ten or 15 substantially equal annual installments.\nIn the event that an Employee’s Deferral Election pursuant to Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b), does not specify both a valid time of payment pursuant to Section 6.5(c)(ii)(A) and a valid form of payment pursuant to Section 6.5(c)(ii)(B), such Employee shall be deemed to have elected a lump-sum payment as of the January 1 or July 1 that is at least six months following his or her Separation from Service (or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter, but in any event no later than 90 days).\nBy way of clarification, an Employee who is not in Band 50 or above as of the Band 50 Determination Date for the prior Plan Year may not file a special election regarding time and form of payment for Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year. Instead, the Supplemental Election (without regard to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election) made pursuant to Section 5.4 will also apply to such Deferral Benefits. However, as set forth above, in the case of a new Participant who is enrolled as a result of being hired into or promoted to Band 50 (or transferring to eligible status while in Band 50 or above) after such date, the Administrator may permit such Employee to participate in open enrollment for the following Plan Year as a Band 50 or above Employee.\n(d) Withholding of Amounts Deferred. For each Plan Year, the Base Salary portion of a Participant’s Deferral Election shall be withheld from each regularly scheduled Base Salary payroll, and the Incentive Pay portion of a Participant’s Deferral Election shall be withheld at the time the Incentive Pay is or otherwise would be paid to the Participant.\nSection 6.6 Crediting of Deferred Amounts. The Administrator shall establish and maintain a Deferral Account with respect to each Participant’s Deferral Benefits. Amounts deferred by a Participant shall be credited to the Deferral Account established for the Participant at such times and in such manner as may be determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may divide the Deferral Account into subaccounts for purposes of tracking earnings and losses in accordance with Article 7.\nARTICLE 7 EARNINGS\nSection 7.1 RP-Related Account. For each Participant, the RP-Related Account established pursuant to Section 5.1 shall be increased by the Imputed Earnings Credit (as such term is defined in the RP), not less frequently than annually, under procedures and at times determined by the Administrator and consistently applied for similarly situated Participants. Such earnings shall be credited at the same interest rate and computed in a similar manner (to the extent administratively feasible) as Imputed Earnings Credits are computed under the RP for each Plan Year.\n26-\nSection 7.2 RSP-Related Account. A Participant’s RSP-Related Account shall be credited with earnings under the\nHypothetical Investment Method set forth below.\nSection 7.3 Deferral Accounts.\n(a) For Plan Year 2011 and later, a Participant’s Deferral Benefits for such Plan Year shall be credited with earnings under the Hypothetical Investment Method set forth below. For the avoidance of doubt, 2010 Incentive Pay paid in 2011 and deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election will be considered 2010 Deferral Benefits for purposes of this Section.\n(b) For Executive Officers, such Participant’s Deferral Benefits for Plan Years prior to 2011 shall be credited with earnings under the Hypothetical Investment Method set forth below effective for all earnings credited in any Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2011 and under the Interest Method set forth below for earnings credited in 2010 and prior Plan Years; provided, however, that earnings credited in 2010 (to the extent not paid out by October 27, 2010) will not exceed the AFR if Amex’s ROE is Below ROE Target Range; and provided further that for those Executive Officers who received payment in the 2010 Plan Year prior to October 27, 2010, earnings on the amounts paid prior to October 27, 2010 were calculated based on the Interest Method without reference to any AFR limitation.\n(c) For Non-Executive Officers, such Participant’s Deferral Benefits for Plan Years prior to 2011 shall be credited with earnings under the Interest Method set forth below through December 31, 2011; provided, however, that if a Participant becomes an Executive Officer during 2011, earnings for 2011 credited to such Participant’s Deferral Benefits for Plan Years prior to 2011 shall not exceed the AFR (except to the extent earnings in excess of the AFR have been paid out prior to the Participant’s becoming an Executive Officer). For 2012 and subsequent years, the Hypothetical Investment Method shall apply.\n(d) For Retirees, such Participant’s Deferral Benefits for Plan Years prior to 2011 shall be credited with earnings under the Interest Method set forth below through December 31, 2012, and under the Hypothetical Investment Method set forth below effective January 1, 2013.\nSection 7.4 Hypothetical Investment Method.\n(a) For each Participant, credits to his or her RSP-Related and Deferral Account (to the extent subject to the Hypothetical Investment Method) shall be made to such subaccounts thereunder as directed by such Participant, using the subaccounts described in Section 5.3, provided, however, that with respect to Deferral Benefits attributable to Plan Years prior to 2011, the Participant may elect to have all or some of such Deferral Benefits invested in an investment option that credits earnings at the AFR instead of in the Stock Fund or the RSP-based investment options, and provided further that no Participant may transfer amounts to the subaccount representing the Stock Fund to the extent that such transfer would result in the aggregate Company Stock holdings of such Participant under the Plan exceeding ten percent of (i) the total value of his or her Deferral Account (determined at the time of the transfer) with respect to the investment of the Deferral Account or (ii) the total value of his or her RSP-Related Account (determined at the time of the transfer) with respect to the investment of the RSP-Related Account, nor may a Participant direct that more than ten percent of new contributions\n27-\nmade to the RSP-Related Account or the Deferral Account, respectively, be directed to the subaccount representing the Stock Fund. If more than one subaccount is available, a Participant must designate, on a form or other medium acceptable to the Administrator, in one-percent increments, the amounts to be credited to each subaccount. A Participant shall be allowed to amend such designation consistent with the frequency of investment changes offered the Participant under rules governing the RSP for a given Plan Year, subject to any different or additional rules as may be established by the Administrator for this Plan. If a Participant has directed the transfer of amounts to the Stock Fund and the credits to the relevant Account of a Participant to the subaccount relating to the Stock Fund would result in the aggregate Company Stock holdings of such Participant under the Plan exceeding ten percent of the total value of such Account (determined at the time of the transfer) or has directed new contributions to an Account to the Stock Fund in an amount which would result in new contributions to such Account’s subaccount representing the Stock Fund exceeding ten percent of new contributions to such Account, then such Participant shall be deemed to have selected, with respect to any such excess, the default subaccount designated by the Administrator (which shall be deemed to be the subaccount representing the fund designated as the default fund under the RSP, unless the Administrator directs the use of a different fund).\n(b) To the extent a Participant elects to invest in the subaccount representing the Stock Fund, subject to Section 7.4(d) and Section 7.6, the limit on such investments set forth above, and such rules as may be adopted by the Administrator, the performance of the book reserve subaccount established for each Participant pursuant to Section 5.3 or Section 6.6 shall reflect the performance of the Stock Fund. Such subaccount shall reflect such increases or decreases in value from time to time, whether from dividends, gains, losses or otherwise, as may be experienced by the Stock Fund. Subject to Section 7.6 and to such rules as may be adopted by the Administrator, a Participant may elect to transfer credits among the Stock Fund and one or more subaccounts representing other investment options in a manner similar to the rules for such transfers under the RSP and such different or additional rules as the Administrator may establish for this Plan; provided, however, no Participant may transfer amounts to the subaccount representing the Stock Fund to the extent that such transfer would violate a limit on such investment established by the Plan or the Administrator.\n(c) To the extent the Participant does not elect (or is not permitted) to invest in the subaccount representing the Stock Fund, subject to Section 7.4(d), and to such rules as may be adopted by the Administrator, the performance of each book reserve subaccount established for each Participant shall reflect the performance of the investment fund that the Participant elects to have such subaccount represent. Each such subaccount shall reflect such increases or decreases in value from time to time, whether from dividends, gains, losses or otherwise, as that experienced by the related investment fund under the RSP or, in the case of the AFR investment option, as indicated by the AFR. Subject to Section 7.6, credits to such subaccounts may be transferred to any other subaccount under the Plan in a manner similar to the rules for such transfers under the RSP, on such terms and at such times as permitted with respect to the related investment funds under the RSP and such similar rules as may be established for the AFR option, subject in each case to such rules as may be adopted by the Administrator for this Plan. If a Participant fails to affirmatively designate one or more subaccounts pursuant to this Section 7.4(c), subject to rules established by the Administrator, such Participant shall be\n28-\ndeemed to have selected a default account selected by the Administrator (which shall be deemed to be the subaccount representing the fund designated as the default fund under the RSP, unless the Administrator directs the use of a different fund). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide that one or more investment funds available under the RSP, including any self-directed brokerage account which may be available under the RSP, shall not be available for designation under the Plan.\n(d) The subaccounts shall be valued subject to such reasonable rules and procedures as the Administrator may adopt and apply to all Participants similarly situated with an effort to value such subaccounts as if amounts designated were invested at similar times and in manners, subject to administrative convenience, as amounts are invested, and subject to the same market fluctuation factors used in valuing such investments in the RSP.\nSection 7.5 Interest Method. With respect to Deferral Accounts governed by the Interest Method:\n(a) Under the Interest Method, a Participant’s Deferral Account for a Plan Year shall be credited with interest equivalents each calendar year at the Schedule Rate in effect for the calendar year, subject to any limitations established under the Plan.\n(b) The amounts in such Deferral Account shall vest as follows:\n(i) Principal. The principal amount of a Participant’s Deferral Account for a Plan Year shall be 100 percent\nvested at all times.\n(ii) Earnings. Until January 1, 2011, with respect to amounts credited with earnings under the Interest Method, the earnings on a Participant’s Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year for a given calendar year at the Minimum Schedule Rate for the calendar year shall be 100 percent vested as such earnings are accrued and credited, and the portion of the earnings on a Participant’s Deferral Benefits for a Plan Year for a given calendar year at the applicable Schedule Rate in excess of the Minimum Schedule Rate for the calendar year, if any, shall become vested on the date that the Participant becomes Retirement Eligible, or upon the earlier death or Disability of the Participant, and thereafter as such earnings are accrued and credited. Effective December 31, 2010, all earnings amounts under the Interest Method with respect to Deferral Benefits not yet paid out shall be fully vested.\nSection 7.6 Special Restrictions.\n(a) The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall apply to Insiders. Such provisions shall apply during all periods that such Participants are Insiders, including any period following cessation of Insider status during which such Participants are required to report transactions pursuant to Rule 16a-2(b) (or its successor) under the Exchange Act. This Section 7.6 shall be automatically applicable to any Participant who, on and after the date hereof, becomes an Insider. For purposes of the foregoing, the effective date of this Section 7.6 shall be the date the Participant becomes an Insider. At such time as any Participant ceases to be an Insider (and any period contemplated by Rule 16a-2(b) has expired), this Section 7.6 shall cease to be applicable to such Participant.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, (i) except as set forth below, credits to the Account of an\nInsider may not be made to a subaccount that reflects the\n29-\nperformance of the Stock Fund, (ii) credits made to the Account of an Insider at any time may not be transferred to a subaccount that reflects the performance of the Stock Fund and (iii) credits made to an Insider’s Account at any time, and credits to a subaccount of an Insider that reflects the performance of the Stock Fund (which credits could only have been made when such individual was not an Insider) may not be transferred, withdrawn, paid out or otherwise changed, other than (A) pursuant to the Participant’s payment election or the rules governing distribution in the event of the Participant’s death (but only at such time as distribution is permitted under the securities rules, it being intended that a delay in the normal payment schedule occur only to the extent required by securities rules, as permitted by Section 409A) or (B) pursuant to applicable forfeiture provisions contained in the Plan.\n(c) It is intended that the crediting of amounts to the accounts of Insiders that represents the performance of the Stock Fund is intended to qualify for exemption from Section 16 under Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act. The Administrator shall, with respect to Insiders, administer and interpret all Plan provisions in a manner consistent with such exemption.\nARTICLE 8 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\nSection 8.1 Supplemental Account Payments (Other than Payments Due to Death or Disability).\n(a) By way of clarification, the rules set forth in this Section shall be applied separately to the portion of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits that is subject to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election and the remainder of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits that is not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election, to the extent that the Participant’s Supplemental Election differs from the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election. Subject to Section 8.1(b), payment of Supplemental Benefits shall be made as follows: (i) if the governing Election calls for a lump-sum payment, it shall be made on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s Separation from Service for any reason (other than death or Disability) from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (ii) if the governing Election calls for annual installment payments, they shall begin on July 1 of the calendar year following the Participant’s Separation from Service for any reason (other than death or Disability) from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each July 1 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant. A Participant who has experienced a Separation from Service and is to receive or has begun receiving payments as set forth above, shall continue receiving any remaining payments according to the terms in effect on the date of his or her Separation from Service, even if later re-employed by the Company.\n(b) If a Participant has made the one-time modification to his or her initial Supplemental Election pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(ii) or Section 5.4(d) and such subsequent Supplemental Election has become effective prior to the Participant’s Separation from Service, then payment of such Participant’s Supplemental Benefits (to the extent governed by the\n30-\namended Election) pursuant to Section 8.1(a) shall be made, or commence in the case of annual installments, on the date that is five years later than the date such Supplemental Benefits would otherwise be made or commence pursuant to Section 8.1(a). The rehire of a Participant during this intervening period will not affect the payment schedule. The Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election may not be modified, and accordingly the portion of the benefit subject to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election will not be subject to any five-year delay.\n(c) If a Participant has elected annual installment payments, each annual installment payment shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of remaining payments (e.g., if the Participant elected five installments, the first annual installment payment would be the amount of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits multiplied by 1/5, the second annual installment payment would be the remaining amount of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits multiplied by 1/4, etc.).\n(d) The payment of Supplemental Benefits to a Participant under this Section 8.1 shall be limited to a Participant’s vested portion of his or her Supplemental Account at the time of distribution. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, a Participant’s vested portion shall be determined under the vesting provisions of the Qualified Retirement Plans. Any non-vested portion of amounts credited to a Participant hereunder shall be forfeited.\nSection 8.2 Deferral Account Payments (Other than Payments Due to Death or Disability).\n(a) Generally Applicable Rules for Payment to Participants. With respect to Post-2010 Deferral Benefits, payments not made on account of death or Disability will be governed by Section 8.1 except to the extent that a Participant was eligible to make a special payment election with respect to such Deferral Benefits pursuant to Section 6.5, in which case payment will be governed by Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), as applicable. Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits not payable on account of death or Disability will be paid in accordance with Section 8.2(b)(i) or Section 8.2(c)(i), as applicable.\n(b) Specified Date Elections for Employees in Band 50 or Above. If a Participant designated a specified date as the time when some or all of the Deferral Benefits of such Participant are to be paid, and the Participant has not had a Separation from Service, died or incurred a Disability as of the specified date, then payment of the Deferral Account shall be made as follows:\n(i) In the case of Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits, (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all of such Deferral Benefits, it shall be made on the first March 15 or September 15 following the specified date (or if the Participant designated March 15 or September 15 as the specified date, payment shall be made on such specified date), or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments of some or all of such Deferral Benefits, payment shall begin on the first March 15 or September 15 following the specified date (or if the Participant designated March 15 or September 15 as the specified date, payment shall begin on such specified date), or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each March 15 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible,\n31-\nbut in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant. If a Participant who is to receive or has begun receiving payments in annual installments under this Section 8.2(b)(i) experiences a Separation from Service before having received all of the annual installments to which the Participant is entitled, then if the Participant is Retirement Eligible at the time of his or her Separation from Service, the Participant shall receive or continue to receive the remaining annual installment payments as scheduled, and if the Participant is not Retirement Eligible at the time of his or her Separation from Service, then the remaining installments shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(i).\n(ii) In the case of Post-2010 Deferral Benefits, (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all of such Deferral Benefits, it shall be made on the first January 1 or July 1 coinciding with or following the specified date or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments of some or all of such Deferral Benefits, payment shall begin on the first January 1 or July 1 coinciding with or following the specified date, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and continue each January 1 or July 1 (as applicable) thereafter (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) for the period selected by the Participant. If a Participant who is to receive or has begun receiving payments in annual installments under this Section 8.2(b)(ii) experiences a Separation from Service before having received all of the annual installments to which the Participant is entitled, then the Participant shall receive or continue to receive the remaining annual installment payments as scheduled.\n(c) Separation from Service for Employees in Band 50 or Above. If a Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason other than death or Disability, regardless of whether the Participant designated a later specified date as the time when some or all Deferral Benefits are to be paid, then Deferral Benefits subject to a Deferral Election that specifies time and form of payment under Section 6.5 will be paid as follows:\n(i) In the case of Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits:\n(A) If a Participant is Retirement Eligible at the time of his or her Separation from Service, then payment of the Participant’s Deferral Benefits shall be made as follows: (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall be made on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s Separation from Service from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments of some or all Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall begin on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s Separation from Service from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each March 15 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant. A Participant who has experienced a Separation from Service and is to receive or has begun receiving payments as set forth above, shall continue receiving any remaining payments according to the terms in effect on the date of his or her Separation from Service, even if later re-employed by the Company.\n32-\n(B) If a Participant is not Retirement Eligible at the time of his or her Separation from Service, then regardless of the Participant’s Deferral Elections, payment of all of the Participant’s Deferral Benefits shall be made in a lump sum on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days.\n(ii) In the case of Post-2010 Deferral Benefits, upon Separation from Service, payment of the Participant’s Deferral Benefits shall be made as follows: (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall be made on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s Separation from Service from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments of some or all Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall begin on the first July 1 in the calendar year following the Participant’s Separation from Service from the Company, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each July 1 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant. A Participant who has experienced a Separation from Service and is to receive or has begun receiving payments as set forth above, shall continue receiving any remaining payments according to the terms in effect on the date of his or her Separation from Service, even if later re-employed by the Company.\n(d) Calculation of Installments. If a Participant will receive payment of some or all Deferral Benefits in annual installment payments, each annual installment payment shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the Deferral Benefits being paid pursuant to such Deferral Election by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of remaining payments (e.g., if the Participant is to receive payment of the entire amount in his or her Deferral Account in five installments, the first annual installment payment would be the amount of the Participant’s Deferral Account multiplied by 1/5, the second annual installment payment would be the remaining amount of such Deferral Account multiplied by 1/4, etc.).\n(e) Payment Limited to Vested Amount. The payment of a Participant’s Deferral Account for a Plan Year under this Section 8.2 shall be limited to a Participant’s vested portion of his or her Deferral Account at the time of distribution. Any non- vested portion of amounts credited to a Participant hereunder shall be forfeited.\nSection 8.3 Designation of Beneficiaries. A Participant may separately designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries entitled to receive payment of his or her Supplemental Account and his or her Deferral Account by filing written notice of such designation with the Administrator in such form as the Administrator may prescribe. A Participant may revoke or modify such designation at any time by a further written designation in such form as the Administrator may prescribe. A Participant’s Beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked in the event of the death of the Beneficiary or, if the Beneficiary is the Participant’s spouse, in the event of dissolution of marriage. If no designation is in effect at the time Benefits payable under the relevant Account become due, the Beneficiary of such Account shall be deemed to be the Participant’s surviving spouse, if any, and if not, the Participant’s estate.\n33-\nEffective for Participants who die on or after January 1, 2013, if a Participant has designated his or her spouse as his or her beneficiary for either or both Accounts, that designation shall automatically become null and void in the event of the Participant’s divorce, without prejudice, however, to any rights the former spouse may be granted pursuant to a domestic relations order applicable to the Plan. In the event that a beneficiary designation is voided hereunder, the benefit shall be paid as if the former spouse had pre-deceased the Participant. A Participant who wishes the former spouse to be his or her beneficiary may file a new beneficiary designation form naming the former spouse after the date of divorce. These rules will also apply in the event a beneficiary is permitted to designate a beneficiary and becomes divorced from the person named as beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Plan nor any other person will be liable for payment made to a named beneficiary prior to the date that the Plan is notified that such person is a divorced spouse.\nSection 8.4 Death.\n(a) Supplemental Account. Upon a Participant’s death, payment of the Participant’s Supplemental Account shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries designated to receive the Participant’s Supplemental Account. If a Participant dies while still actively employed by the Company, the payment of his or her Supplemental Account shall be made as a single lump- sum payment on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. If a Participant elects annual installment payments and dies after such installment payments have commenced (or while waiting for installments to commence in the event that payment was delayed following Separation from Service as the result of a modification of a Supplemental Election), any remaining installment payments shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as a single lump-sum payment on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. By way of clarification, if a Participant dies after Separation from Service but before the January 1 or July 1 (or other payment date within 90 days thereafter) that is six months after the Separation from Service, payment in a lump sum shall be made to the beneficiary on the originally scheduled date. To the extent however, that the Participant’s payment had been delayed five years due to his or her modification of his or her Supplemental Election, the Plan will make payment in accordance with the death benefit provisions and will not wait for the five-year period to elapse.\n(b) Deferral Account. Upon a Participant’s death, payment of the Participant’s Deferral Account shall be made to\nthe Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries designated to receive the Participant’s Deferral Account.\n(i) With respect to Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits, if a Participant dies while still actively employed by the Company, the payment of his or her Deferral Account shall be made as a single lump-sum payment on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. If a Participant elects annual installment payments and dies after such installment payments have commenced, any remaining installment payments shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as a single lump- sum payment on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as\n34-\nsoon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. By way of clarification, if a Participant dies after Separation from Service but before the March 15 or September 15 (or other payment date within 90 days thereafter) that is six months after the Separation from Service, payment in a lump sum shall be made to the beneficiary on the originally scheduled date.\n(ii) With respect to Post-2010 Deferral Benefits, if a Participant dies while still actively employed by the Company, the payment of his or her Deferral Account shall be made as a single lump-sum payment on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. If a Participant elects annual installment payments and dies after such installment payments have commenced (or while waiting for installments to commence in the event that payment was delayed following Separation from Service as the result of a modification of a Supplemental Election applicable to such Deferral Benefits), any remaining installment payments shall be made to the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as a single lump-sum payment on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s death, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days. By way of clarification, if a Participant dies after Separation from Service but before the January 1 or July 1 (or other payment date within 90 days thereafter) that is six months after the Separation from Service, payment in a lump sum shall be made to the beneficiary on the originally scheduled date. To the extent however, that the Participant’s payment had been delayed five years due to his or her modification of a Supplemental Election that also applies to his or her Deferral Benefits, the Plan will make payment in accordance with the death benefit provisions and will not wait for the five-year period to elapse.\nSection 8.5 Disability.\n(a) Supplemental Account. By way of clarification, the rules set forth in this Section shall be applied separately to the portion of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits that is subject to the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election and the remainder of the Participant’s Supplemental Benefits that is not covered by the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election, to the extent that the Participant’s Supplemental Election differs from the Automatic New Participant Supplemental Election. In the event of the Disability of a Participant, payment of the Participant’s Supplemental Account shall be made as follows: (i) if the governing Election calls for a lump-sum payment of his or her Supplemental Account, payment shall be made on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (ii) if the governing Election calls for annual installment payments of his or her Supplemental Account, payment shall begin on July 1 of the calendar year following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each July 1 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant.\n(b) Deferral Accounts. In the event of the Disability of a Participant, payment of the Participant’s Deferral Benefits\nshall be made as follows:\n35-\n(i) With respect to Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits, (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all of his or her Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall be made on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments with respect to some or all of his or her Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall begin on the first March 15 or September 15 which is at least six months following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each March 15 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant for such Deferral Benefits.\n(ii) With respect to Post-2010 Deferral Benefits, (A) if the Participant elected a lump-sum payment of some or all of his or her Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall be made on the first January 1 or July 1 which is at least six months following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days; and (B) if the Participant elected annual installment payments with respect to some or all of his or her Deferral Benefits, payment of such Deferral Benefits shall begin on July 1 of the calendar year following the Participant’s date of Disability, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days, and shall continue on each July 1 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in no event later than 90 days) thereafter for the period selected by the Participant for such Deferral Benefits.\nSection 8.6 Unforeseeable Emergency. If a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Administrator to receive a partial or full payout from the Plan. The payout, if any, from the Plan shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Participant’s vested Account balance, or (b) the amount necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. A Participant shall not be eligible to receive a payout from the Plan to the extent that the Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship or (iii) by cessation of a Deferral Election under this Plan. If the Administrator, in its sole discretion, approves a Participant’s petition for payout from the Plan, such payout shall be made in a lump sum on the date on which such approval occurs, or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter, but in no event later than 90 days. At the time of its determination, and to the extent permissible by Section 409A, the Administrator shall determine how any payment under this Section 8.6 will be applied against the Participant’s Account and the subaccounts thereunder.\nSection 8.7 Company Offset. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan, the RP or the RSP to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 409A and applicable law, any amount otherwise due or payable under the Plan may be forfeited, or its payment suspended, at the discretion of the Administrator, to apply toward or recover any claim the Company may have against the Participant, including but not limited to, for the enforcement of Amex’s Detrimental Conduct provisions under its long-term incentive award plan, to recover a debt to the Company or to recover a benefit overpayment under a Company benefit plan or program. No amounts\n36-\nshall be offset against a Participant’s Account prior to the date on which the offset amounts would otherwise be distributed to the Participant unless otherwise permitted by Section 409A. An offset shall be made only to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Section 409A Policy.\nSection 8.8 Withholding. The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income and employment taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and, to the extent permissible under Section 409A, as a condition of the making of such payment.\nSection 8.9 De Minimis Lump Sum Payment. Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Plan, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, make a mandatory lump sum pay-out of a Participant’s Account at any time, provided that such pay-out amount shall be in an amount equal to the lump sum value of such Account determined for the date of such pay-out; and further provided that such pay-out (1) accompanies the termination and liquidation of the Participant’s entire interest under the Plan and all similar arrangements that constitute an account balance plan under Section 1.409A-1(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations; and (2) the payment is not greater than the applicable dollar amount under Section 402(g)(1)(B) of the Code.\nARTICLE 9 CHANGE IN CONTROL\nSection 9.1 Change in Control. “Change in Control” means the happening of any of the following:\n(a) Any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a “Person”) becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25 percent or more of either (i) the then outstanding common shares of Amex (the “Outstanding Company Common Shares”) or (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Amex entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the “Outstanding Company Voting Securities”); provided, however, that such beneficial ownership shall not constitute a Change in Control if it occurs as a result of any of the following acquisitions of securities: (A) any acquisition directly from Amex; (B) any acquisition by Amex or any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity controlled by Amex (a “Subsidiary”); (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by Amex or any Subsidiary; (D) any acquisition by an underwriter temporarily holding Amex securities pursuant to an offering of such securities; (E) any acquisition by an individual, entity or group that is permitted to, and actually does, report its beneficial ownership on Schedule 13-G (or any successor schedule), provided that, if any such individual, entity or group subsequently becomes required to or does report its beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D (or any successor schedule), then, for purposes of this subsection, such individual, entity or group shall be deemed to have first acquired, on the first date on which such individual, entity or group becomes required to or does so report, beneficial ownership of all of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by it on such date; or (F) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a reorganization, merger or consolidation if, following such reorganization, merger or\n37-\nconsolidation, the conditions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 9.1(c) are satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the “Subject Person”) became the beneficial owner of 25 percent or more of the Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities by Amex which, by reducing the number of Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities, increases the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by the Subject Person; provided, that if a Change in Control would be deemed to have occurred (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities by Amex, and after such share acquisition by Amex, the Subject Person becomes the beneficial owner of any additional Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall then be deemed to have occurred; or\n(b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by Amex’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board, including by reason of agreement intended to avoid or settle any such actual or threatened contest or solicitation; or\n(c) The consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange, consolidation, or similar corporate transaction involving Amex or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries (each a “Business Combination”), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (i) the Outstanding Company Common Shares and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination, continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or being converted into voting securities of the resulting or surviving entity or any parent thereof) more than 50 percent of the then- outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation that, as a result of such transaction, owns Amex or all or substantially all of Amex’s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries), (ii) no Person (excluding Amex, any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of Amex, a Subsidiary or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination or any parent or subsidiary thereof, and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such Business Combination, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of the Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (or any parent thereof) or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such\n38-\ncorporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (or any parent thereof) were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or action of the Board providing for such Business Combination; or\n(d) The consummation of the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Amex, unless such assets have been sold, leased, exchanged or disposed of to a corporation with respect to which following such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition (i) more than 50 percent of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation (or any parent thereof) entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Shares and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of such Outstanding Company Common Shares and Outstanding Company Voting Shares, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding Amex and any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of Amex or a Subsidiary or of such corporation or a subsidiary thereof and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of the Outstanding Company Common Shares or Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 25 percent or more of respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation (or any parent thereof) and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation (or any parent thereof) entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such corporation (or any parent thereof) were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or action of the Board providing for such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of assets of Amex;

This Section 9.2 shall apply in the event of a Change in Control.\n(a) Rabbi Trust. Notwithstanding Section 12.1 and any other provision herein to the contrary, to the extent permitted by Section 409A without penalty, effective immediately upon a Change in Control, the entire value of each Participant’s Account under the Plan shall be maintained in the Trust established by Amex for this purpose and the Company shall transfer to the Trust an amount sufficient to fund the entire value of each Participant’s Account.\n(b) Account Earnings.\n(i) RSP-Related Account.\n(A) Notwithstanding Section 7.4(b), effective immediately upon a Change in Control, to the extent a subaccount of an RSP-Related Account established on behalf of a Participant reflects, or by the terms of the Plan should in the future reflect, the\n39-\nperformance of the Stock Fund, it shall thereafter reflect the performance of the Stable Value Fund.\n(B) Notwithstanding Section 7.4(c), in the event that any time after a Change in Control either (A) the RSP is frozen or terminated and is not replaced by a comparable qualified investment savings plan, or (B) there are no investment funds available under the RSP (or successor qualified investment savings plan) to which a Participant may direct the investment of his or her RSP-Related Account, then a Participant’s RSP-Related Account shall thereafter be credited with earnings of at least the AFR.\n(ii) Deferral Accounts.\n(A) If earnings are credited to all or part of a Deferral Account under the Interest Method, notwithstanding Article 7, effective immediately upon a Change in Control, the applicable Schedule Rate shall be no less than the Moody’s A Rate for the year of the Change in Control and any year thereafter during which the Interest Method applies, provided that in the case of a person who is an Executive Officer for purposes of Article 7, the applicable Schedule Rate shall be no greater than the AFR if Amex’s (or its successor’s) ROE is Below Target Range.\n(B) If earnings are credited to all or part of a Deferral Account under the Hypothetical Investment Method, the relevant portion of such Account shall be handled in the same manner as the Participant’s RSP-Related Account under Section 9.2(b)(i).\n(C) If a Participant who is eligible to receive lump-sum separation pay under the Severance Plan experiences a Separation from Service within the two-year period following a Change in Control, and the Participant would have become Retirement Eligible during the serial separation period for which the Participant would have been eligible in a non-Change- in-Control situation, then upon such Separation from Service, the Participant shall immediately become 100 percent vested in the earnings on his or her Deferral Account under Section 7.5(b)(i) as if the Participant were Retirement Eligible on the date of the Separation from Service, if not already fully vested.\n(c) Golden Parachute Excise Taxes.\n(i) In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by a Participant hereunder in connection with a Change in Control or termination of such Participant’s employment (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Payments”) will be subject to the excise tax referred to in Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then the Payments shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Payments is subject to the Excise Tax but only if (a) the net amount of all Total Payments (as hereinafter defined), as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and employment taxes on such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (b) the net amount of such Total Payments without any such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income and employment taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which the Participant would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments; provided, however, that the Participant may elect in writing to have other components of his or her Total Payments reduced prior to any reduction in the Payments hereunder.\n40-\n(ii) For purposes of determining whether the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, the amount of such Excise Tax and whether any Payments are to be reduced hereunder: (A) all payments and benefits received or to be received by the Participant in connection with such Change in Control or the termination of such Participant’s employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any Person whose actions result in such Change in Control, or any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person (collectively, “Total Payments”) shall be treated as “parachute payments” (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of the accounting firm which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Company’s independent auditor, or if that firm refuses to serve, by another qualified firm, whether or not serving as independent auditors, designated by the Committee (the “Firm”), such payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, including by reason of Section 280G(2)(A) or Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code; (B) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Participant shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a “payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account; (C) all “excess parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of the Firm, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the meaning of Section 280G(g)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the “base amount” (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax; and (D) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Firm in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code and regulations or other guidance thereunder. For purposes of determining whether any Payments in respect of a Participant shall be reduced, a Participant shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation (and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of such Participant’s residence, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes) in the calendar year in which the Payments are made. The Firm will be paid reasonable compensation by the Company for its services.\n(iii) As soon as practicable following a Change in Control, but in no event later than 30 days thereafter, the Company shall provide to each Participant with respect to whom it is proposed that Payments be reduced, a written statement setting forth the manner in which the Total Payments in respect of such Participant were calculated and the basis for such calculations, including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice the Company has received from the Firm or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement).\nARTICLE 10 CLAIMS PROCEDURES\nSection 10.1 Claim.\n(a) A claimant who believes that he or she is being denied Benefits to which he or she is entitled under the Plan or\nwho otherwise has a claim involving the Plan may file a\n41-\nwritten request for such Benefits or written description of the claim (as applicable) with the Administrator, setting forth his or her claim for Benefits or other claim involving the Plan.\n(b) No action may be commenced against any Plan party after the earliest to occur of the following dates: the date that is 90 days after the date of the final denial of the appeal, or the date that is one year from the date a cause of action accrued. For purposes of this Article 10, a cause of action is considered to have accrued when the person bringing the legal action knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that a Plan party has clearly repudiated the claim or legal position which is the subject of the action, regardless of whether such person has filed a claim in accordance with the provisions of this Article 10. The Administrator shall be the Plan’s agent for service of process.\n(c) Any person requesting Benefits or wishing to assert a claim must exhaust all remedies under the Plan’s claims\nprocedures before being entitled to seek relief under Section 10.5.\nSection 10.2 Claim Decision.\n(a) Except as otherwise provided by Section 10.2(b), the Administrator shall reply to any claim filed under Section 10.1 within 90 days of receipt, unless it determines to extend such reply period for an additional 90 days for reasonable cause and notifies the claimant in advance of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to make a decision. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, such reply shall include a written explanation, using language calculated to be understood by the claimant, setting forth:\n(i) the specific reason or reasons for such denial;\n(ii) the specific reference to relevant provisions of the Plan on which such denial is based;\n(iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her\nclaim and an explanation why such material or such information is necessary;\n(iv) appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to submit the claim for review,\nincluding an explanation of the claimant’s right to access and receive copies of relevant documents;\n(v) the time limits for requesting a review under Section 10.3 and for review under Section 10.4; and\n(vi) the claimant’s right to bring an action under Section 502 of ERISA (subject to Section 10.5) if the claim\nis denied on review.\n(b) If the claim is a claim that requires a determination regarding whether a Participant is disabled to be made by the Administrator (and not by some party other than the Administrator or the Plan for purposes other than a benefit determination under the Plan), the Administrator will respond to the claim within a reasonable period of time and in any case within 45 days (provided that the Administrator may utilize up to two 30-day extension periods, in each case to the extent that the Administrator determines that circumstances beyond the control of the Plan so require, and shall in each case provide the claimant with an advance notice setting forth\n42-\nthe reasons for the extension and the date by which the Administrator expects to render a decision, the standards on which entitlement to Benefits is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and the additional information needed to resolve such issues). In the event that additional information is necessary to resolve a claim requiring the Administrator to rule on the Participant’s disabled status, the claimant shall be afforded at least 45 days to provide the information (during which time the periods to provide notice and a decision on the claim shall be tolled).\n(c) In the event of a claim requiring the Administrator to rule on the Participant’s disabled status, the Administrator’s written notice of claim denial shall provide the claimant (in addition to the items described in Section 10.2(a)) with (i) a discussion of the decision, including an explanation of the basis for disagreeing with or not following the views presented by the claimant to the Administrator of health care professionals treating the claimant and vocational professionals who evaluated the claimant, the views of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with the claim denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon by the Administrator in denying the claim, and a determination of disability by the Social Security Administration presented by the claimant to the Administrator, (ii) a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion relied upon during the claims process or a statement that no such internal rules, guidelines, protocols or other similar criteria exist, and (iii) if a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit was imposed, the Administrator will provide an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination (applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant’s medical circumstances) or a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge upon request.\nSection 10.3 Request for Review.\n(a) Except as otherwise provided by Section 10.3(b), within 60 days after the receipt by the claimant of the written explanation described above, the claimant may request in writing that the Administrator review its determination. The claimant, or his or her duly authorized representative, may, but need not, review the relevant documents and submit issues and comments in writing for consideration by the Administrator. Reasonable access to and copies of any documents, records and other information relevant to the claim will be provided free of charge upon request, subject to attorney-client, attorney work-product and other applicable privilege rules unless otherwise required by ERISA. Except as otherwise provided by Section 10.3(b), if the claimant does not request a review of the initial determination within such 60-day period, the claimant shall be barred and estopped from challenging the determination.\n(b) In the event of a claim requiring the Administrator to make a determination regarding the Participant’s disabled status, the claimant shall have 180 days after receipt of the written explanation described above to request in writing that the determination be reviewed, and shall be barred and estopped from challenging the determination if he or she does not request a review of the initial determination within such 180-day period.\nSection 10.4 Review of Decision.\n(a) After considering all materials presented by the claimant, the Administrator will render a written decision,\nsetting forth the specific reasons for the decision\n43-\nand containing specific references to the relevant provisions of the Plan on which the decision is based. The decision on review shall normally be made within 60 days after the Administrator’s receipt of the claimant’s claim or request. If an extension of time is required for a hearing or other special circumstances, the claimant shall be notified of the reasons for the extension and the date as of which the Administrator expects to make a decision, and the time limit shall be 120 days. If additional information is needed, the deadline for the Administrator’s responses will be tolled for the time period granted to the claimant to provide the information (or the date that the claimant actually provides the information, if earlier). The decision shall be in writing using language calculated to be understood by the claimant, and shall set forth:\n(i) the specific reason or reasons for such denial;\n(ii) the specific reference to relevant provisions of the Plan on which such denial is based;\n(iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled, upon request and free of charge, to receive reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant’s claim (subject to attorney-client, attorney work-product and other applicable privilege rules unless otherwise required by ERISA); and\n(iv) the claimant’s right to bring an action under Section 502 of ERISA now that the claim has been denied on appeal (subject to Section 10.5) and, in the case of a decision regarding the Participant’s disabled status, the applicable limitations period under Section 10.1(b) that applies to the claimant’s right to bring such an action, including the calendar date on which the claimant’s right to bring such an action expires.\n(b) In the event of a claim requiring the Administrator to make a determination regarding the Participant’s disabled status, the Administrator shall ensure that no deference is afforded to the prior determination, that the persons who made the initial determination on behalf of the Administrator shall not be involved in the review, and that the persons who make the decision on review on behalf of the Administrator are not subordinates of the original decision-makers. The Administrator shall not consider, generate or rely upon any new or additional information, or issue an appeal denial based on any new or additional rationale, without first providing the claimant, free of charge, with the new or additional evidence or rationale. The information shall be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the deadline for the Administrator to render a decision on review so that the claimant will have a reasonable opportunity to respond prior to that date. In the event that a medical judgment is required, the persons conducting the review shall consult with a health care professional of appropriate training and experience in the relevant field of medicine and shall identify any medical or vocational experts consulted to the claimant. No health care professional consulted in the course of the review shall be a person consulted in the course of the original determination (or a subordinate of such person). The claim determination on review of a claim requiring the Administrator to make a determination regarding the Participant’s disabled status shall be provided within 45 days (90 days, if the Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension and so informs the claimant). If additional information is needed, the deadline for the Administrator’s response will be tolled for the time period granted to the claimant to provide the information (or the date that the claimant actually provides the information, if earlier). In the event of such a claim denial, in addition to the items required\n44-\nabove, the Administrator shall provide (i) a discussion of the decision, including an explanation of the basis for disagreeing with or not following the views presented by the claimant to the Administrator of health care professionals treating the claimant and vocational professionals who evaluated the claimant, the views of medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with the claim denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon by the Administrator in denying the claim, and a determination of disability by the Social Security Administration presented by the claimant to the Administrator, (ii) a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion relied upon during the claims process or a statement that no such internal rules, guidelines, protocols or other similar criteria exist, and (iii) if a medical necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit was imposed, the Administrator will provide an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination (applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant’s medical circumstances) or a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge upon request.\n(c) All decisions on review shall be final and shall bind all parties concerned to the maximum extent permitted by\nlaw.\nSection 10.5 Arbitration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and except with respect to a claim which requires the Administrator to make a determination with respect to the Participant’s disabled status (unless the Participant consents to binding arbitration of such claim) or any other claim as to which mandatory arbitration is prohibited by law and the claimant does not consent to arbitration, upon completion of the claims process set forth in this Article 10, the Administrator or a claimant will have the right to compel binding arbitration with respect to any claim involving the Plan. By way of clarification, the right to compel binding arbitration applies with equal force to any claim which the claimant attempts to bring outside the claims process, but the Plan requires the claimant to exhaust his or her administrative remedies before arbitrating or litigating his or her claim. If any party to a claim chooses to compel arbitration, the process and procedure shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Policy, to the extent such Policy is consistent with the terms of the Plan. This includes, but is not limited to, the Policy’s prohibition against claims being arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a representative capacity on behalf of any other similarly situated party, and therefore all Plan Participants, Beneficiaries and persons claiming to be a Participant or Beneficiary, as well as any other person with a claim involving the Plan, waive the right to act on a representative basis with respect to the Plan or any other person or class of persons in an arbitration proceeding hereunder or to be part of any class action; provided, however, that this Section is not intended to, and does not, waive or invalidate any statutory rights or remedies that cannot be waived or invalidated hereby, and in the event that a remedy cannot be granted in arbitration pursuant to the terms of this clause, such a remedy may, if required by law to be available in the claimant’s situation without the possibility of waiver, be sought in court. In addition, if any party chooses to compel arbitration, the arbitrator will be bound by the substantive terms of the Plan and ERISA (including, but not limited to, the standard of review required by ERISA, which requires the arbitrator to defer to the factual findings and Plan interpretations of the Administrator unless such findings and interpretations are arbitrary and capricious).\n45-\nSection 10.6 Burden of Proof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent a claimant asserts entitlement to Benefits or otherwise makes a claim based upon facts not contained in the Plan’s records, such person shall be required to provide satisfactory affirmative evidence of such facts. For the avoidance of doubt, if a person claims entitlement to Benefits based upon service or compensation (including but not limited to claims with respect to Base Salary, Incentive Pay, or Compensation for RSP- Related Account or RP-Related Account purposes) that is not reflected in the Plan’s records, such person must provide satisfactory affirmative evidence of such service or compensation. The Administrator shall have the sole and exclusive discretion to determine whether the above-referenced affirmative evidence is satisfactory.\nSection 10.7 Administrator’s Sole Authority. Notwithstanding Section 3.2 or any other provision of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the sole and exclusive authority with respect to any matter, action or decision under this Article 10, and the Committee shall have neither any authority with respect to such matters, nor the right or ability to limit or to interfere in any way with the Administrator’s authority with respect to such matters.\nARTICLE 11 AMENDMENT & TERMINATION\nSection 11.1 Plan Amendment. The Committee or its delegate may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, provided that the Committee may not reduce or modify the amount of any Benefit payable to a Participant or any Beneficiary receiving Benefit payments at the time the Plan is amended or terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have the right to amend or modify the terms and provisions of the Plan to the extent such amendment or modification would result in a violation of Section 409A. In particular, amendments to the definitions of Base Salary or Incentive Pay hereunder shall not be made in a manner which would result in an impermissible alteration to an existing Deferral Election.\nSection 11.2 Effect of Plan Termination. If the Plan is terminated, no additional deferrals or contributions shall be credited to any Participant Account hereunder. Following Plan termination, Participants’ Accounts shall be paid at such time and in such form as provided under Article 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either at the time of termination or on a subsequent date, the Committee may, in its discretion, determine to distribute the then existing Account balances of Participants and Beneficiaries and, following such distribution, there shall be no further obligation to any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan; provided, however, that the authority granted to the Committee under this Section 11.2 shall be implemented in compliance with the requirements of and only to the extent permissible under Section 409A.\nARTICLE 12 GENERAL PROVISIONS\nSection 12.1 Unfunded Status. Nothing in the Plan shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or fiduciary relationship between the Company and the Participant, his or her designated Beneficiary, or any other person. Any funds deferred under the provisions of the Plan shall be construed for all purposes as a part of the general funds of the Company, and any right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan shall be no greater than the right\n46-\nof any unsecured general creditor. The Company may, but need not, purchase any securities or instruments as a means of hedging its obligations to any Participant under the Plan.\nSection 12.2 Non-Transferable. The right of any Participant, or other person, to the payment of deferred compensation\nunder the Plan shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered except by the laws of descent and distribution.\nSection 12.3 No Right to Continued Employment. Participation in the Plan shall not be construed as conferring upon the Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company as an executive or in any other capacity. The Company expressly reserves the right to dismiss any employee at any time without liability for the effect such dismissal might have upon him or her hereunder.\nSection 12.4 Plan Benefits Not Compensation Under Employee Benefit Plans. Any deferred compensation payable under the Plan shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to the Participant for the purpose of computing the benefits under any plan or arrangement (including but not limited to any “employee benefit plan” under ERISA) except as expressly provided in such plan or arrangement.\nSection 12.5 Compliance with Section 409A. The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A, and shall be interpreted, operated and administered consistent with this intent and the Section 409A Policy. To the extent the terms of the Plan fail to qualify for exemption from or to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the Plan may be operated in compliance with Section 409A pending amendment to the extent authorized by the Internal Revenue Service. In such circumstances, the Plan will be administered in a manner which adheres as closely as possible to its existing terms while complying with Section 409A.\nSection 12.6 No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.\n(a) The Company makes no representations or warranties and assumes no responsibility as to the tax consequences to any Participant who enters into a deferred compensation agreement with the Company pursuant to the Plan or any such Participant’s Beneficiary. Further, payment by the Company to the Participant (or to a Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries) in accordance with the terms of the Plan, including any designation of Beneficiary on file with the Administrator at the time of the Participant’s death, shall be binding on all interested parties and persons, including the Participant’s heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and shall discharge the Company, its directors, officers and employees from all claims, demands, actions or causes of action of every kind arising out of or on account of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, known or unknown, for himself or herself, his or her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\n(b) No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the Company and its directors, officers, agents and employees, makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax treatment, including, but not limited to, Federal, state and local income, estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable to any amounts deferred under the Plan, or paid to or for the benefit of a Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant or Beneficiary on account of participation in the Plan.\n47-\n(c) Any agreement executed pursuant to the Plan shall be deemed to include the above provision of this\nSection 12.6.\nSection 12.7 Limitations on Liability. Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any account under the Plan, nor the payment of any benefits under the Plan shall be construed as giving to any Participant or other person any legal or equitable right against the Company, or any officer or employer thereof except as provided by law or by any Plan provision. No person (including the Company) in any way guarantees any Participant’s Account from loss or depreciation, whether caused by poor investment performance of a deemed investment or the inability to realize upon an investment due to an insolvency affecting an investment vehicle or any other reason. In no event shall the Company or any successor, employee, officer, director or stockholder of the Company, be liable to any person on account of any claim arising by reason of the provisions of the Plan or of any instrument or instruments implementing its provisions (except that the Company shall make benefit payments in accordance with the terms of the Plan), or for the failure of any Participant, Beneficiary or other person to be entitled to any particular tax consequences with respect to the Plan, or any credit or distribution hereunder.\nSection 12.8 Severability. If any provision of the Plan is held to be illegal or void, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan, but shall be fully severable, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.\nSection 12.9 Captions. The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be\nconsidered part of the Plan, and shall not be considered in the construction of the Plan.\nSection 12.10 Governing Law. The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of\nNew York to the extent not superseded by federal law, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws.\n* * * *\n48-\nSCHEDULE A\nDEFERRAL ACCOUNT SCHEDULE RATE\nUnder the Interest Method, the Schedule Rate used to determine the earnings credited on a Participant’s Deferral Accounts for such calendar year shall be determined under the following metric, based on Amex’s “ROE” for such calendar year and its “ROE Target Range” for such calendar year:\nAmex’s ROE Below ROE Target Range Within ROE Target Range Above ROE Target Range\nSchedule Rate Moody’s A Rate 9% 11%\nAmounts credited under this Schedule are subject to any caps imposed by Article 7 of the Plan, including the limitation of amounts credited to an Executive Officer to an amount which will not exceed the AFR when required by Section 7.3.\nAmex’s “ROE” for a calendar year means Amex’s consolidated annual return on equity for such calendar year, as reported by Amex, subject to adjustment for significant accounting changes as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.\nAmex’s “ROE Target Range” for a calendar year means the ROE target range announced by Amex and in effect on January 1st of such calendar year.\nExcept as otherwise provided by Section 9.2(b)(ii) of the Plan, the Schedule Rate under this Schedule A for any calendar year may be changed by the Committee, prospectively or retrospectively, in its sole discretion, without prior notice to or consent of Participants or Beneficiaries.\n49-\nSCHEDULE B\nRESERVED\n50-\nSCHEDULE C\nPrior Deferral Plan Benefit Payment Appendix\nPursuant to Section 1.3 of the Plan, this Schedule C sets forth in greater detail the payment timing rules applicable to Deferral Plan benefits attributable to years prior to 2011 and governed by earlier deferral plans maintained by the Company that have been consolidated into the Plan.\nNothing herein alters the timing or form of a payment from the timing or form applicable under the governing plan document. In the event of any conflict, the governing plan document will control. This Schedule C is intended to be used for administrative purposes only, and may be updated or clarified from time to time by the Administrator without further authorization from the Company, provided that no modification to this Schedule C can alter the time or form of a benefit payment or otherwise have any impact not permitted by Section 409A of the Code.\nPayment dates are approximate; payment may be made within 90 days of the identified payment date in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code.\nPre-2008 Deferral Plans\nSome pre-2008 plans include money that was earned and vested as of December 31, 2004 and has been treated as “grandfathered” and thus exempt from Section 409A. Principal for years up to and including 2004 is considered grandfathered, as is interest for years prior to 1999, and interest in the 1999-2004 years to the extent that the Participant was Retirement Eligible by December 31, 2004. Interest for the 1999-2004 Deferral Plans for Participants who were not Retirement Eligible by December 31, 2004 is never considered grandfathered, regardless of whether it exceeded the minimum interest crediting amount for the year. “Grandfathered” status does not have a practical impact except in the case of an employee who receives severance payments from the Company.\nReferences to “termination of employment” or similar concepts refer to “Separation from Service” for non-grandfathered benefits. For grandfathered benefits, the definition in effect under the prior plan document will control.\nThe rules governing these benefits are NOT reflected in Article 8 of the Plan, which addresses only Deferral Plan benefits from 2008-2010 (as “Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits”) and current Deferral Plan benefits (as “Post-2010 Deferral Benefits”).\nIf a Participant elected to be paid at a specified date or as of retirement + X years (X could be up to 10)\no If the Participant elected a specified date AND is still active on the specified date, the Participant will be paid according to specified date election (this rule will NEVER be applicable to a Participant who elected payment as of retirement + X years):\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 on/following the elected\ndate.\n51-\n1\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 on/following elected date,\nwith subsequent installments paid on each March 15.\nl If termination occurs during payment, and the Participant is not Retirement Eligible upon termination, the remainder of the installments are paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/Sept 15 that is at least 6 months following termination.\no If the Participant is Retirement Eligible at the time of termination, the Participant will be paid according to\nelections:\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 on/following the specified\ndate (even if later than termination of employment). For example:\nl Participant elected to be paid on March 15, 2015. The Participant terminates employment on January 1, 2013, and is Retirement Eligible at that time. Payment will be made on March 15, 2015.\nl Participant elected to be paid five years after retirement. The Participant retires in 2013 and is\nRetirement Eligible at that time. Payment will be made in 2018.\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 on/following elected date (even if later than termination of employment), subsequent installments will be paid on each March 15.\nn Commencement could be AFTER retirement. (This is different from the rule for current Deferral Plan\nbenefits.)\no If a Participant was not Retirement Eligible upon termination, and terminates from employment before the specified date, the Participant is paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months following termination.\no If the Participant is going out on severance, see Severance Flow Chart and follow questions. Severance may delay start of any payments based on termination of employment/retirement for GRANDFATHERED amounts, since it may delay deemed termination of employment.\nn If the Participant elected to be paid at retirement\no If the Participant is Retirement Eligible upon termination, the Participant will be paid according to elections:\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months\nfollowing retirement.\n“Retirement Eligible” means that the Participant is at least age 55 AND has at least 10 years of service.\n52-\n1\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months\nfollowing retirement; subsequent installments will be paid on each March 15.\no If not Retirement Eligible upon termination, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at\nleast 6 months following termination.\no If the Participant is going out on severance, see Severance Flow Chart and follow questions. Severance may delay start of any payments based on termination of employment/retirement for GRANDFATHERED amounts based on termination of employment, since it may delay deemed termination of employment.\nn If the Participant leaves the Company as a result of Disability\no The Participant will be paid according to elections.\no If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months\nfollowing date of disability.\no If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months following\ndate of disability; subsequent installments will be paid on each March 15.\nn If the Participant dies before payments begin or before receiving all installments\no The balance of the Participant’s account will be paid as a lump sum to the Participant’s designated beneficiary\non the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months following date of death.\n2008-2010 Plans\nThese plans do not include any “grandfathered” money and are subject to Section 409A of the Code in their entirety. The rules governing these benefits are set forth in Article 8 of the Plan document as the rules applicable to “Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits.”\nn If the Participant elected to be paid on a specified date\no If the Participant does not separate from service prior to the specified date, the Participant will be paid\naccording to elections:\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 on/following the elected\ndate.\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 on/following elected date;\nsubsequent installments will be paid on each March 15.\nl If Separation from Service occurs during payment, and the Participant is not Retirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, the remainder of the installments are paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/Sept 15 that is at least 6 months following Separation from Service. If the Participant is\n53-\nRetirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, installments continue on schedule.\no If the Participant separates from service before the specified date and is Retirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, the Participant will be paid according to the elected form (lump sum or installments) but always as of the first March 15/September 15 that is six months following separation from service:\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is six months following\nSeparation from Service.\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15 that is six months following\nSeparation from Service, subsequent installments paid on each March 15.\nn Note that payment will NOT be delayed until the specified date, in contrast to the pre-2008 rule.\no If the Participant is not Retirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, and separates from service prior to the specified date, the Participant will be paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months following termination.\no Severance status will NOT affect payment of benefits from these years; no benefits are grandfathered and\nhence severance does not delay Separation from Service.\nn If the Participant elected to be paid at retirement\no If the Participant is Retirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, the Participant is paid according to\nelections:\nn If lump sum elected, paid in a lump sum on the first March 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months\nfollowing Separation from Service.\nn If installments elected, payments begin on the first March 15/September 15, that is at least 6 months\nfollowing Separation from Service; subsequent installments will be paid on each March 15.\no If the Participant is not Retirement Eligible upon Separation from Service, paid in a lump sum on the first\nMarch 15/September 15 that is at least 6 months following Separation from Service.\no Severance status will not affect payment of benefits from these years; none of them are grandfathered and\nhence severance does not delay separation from service.\nn If the Participant dies or is Disabled, the usual death/Disability benefit rules for Pre-2011 Deferral Benefits apply\n54-\nSpecial Rule for Degrandfathered Participants’ Degrandfathered Benefits Under Section 1.3 of the Plan\nThese rules apply to degrandfathered principal only. Interest for the relevant years was never grandfathered, and hence is not affected by the degrandfathering transition. For the interest portion of the account balance, see the rules for Pre-2008 Deferral Plan benefits.\nn If the Participant did NOT Make an election regarding degrandfathered benefits\no The Participant will be paid in a lump sum in March of 2012.\nn If the Participant elected a specified date and that specified date occurs prior to Participant’s Separation from\nService\no Specified date could not be earlier than July 2017.\no If the Participant elected a lump sum, the Participant will be paid in a lump sum on the January 1 or July 1 that is the specified date; if the Participant elected installments, the first installment will be paid on the January 1 or July 1 that is the specified date, and subsequent installments will be paid on each January 1 or July 1 (the same as the first payment) thereafter.\no If the Participant separates from service after the specified date but during the payment period, payments\ncontinue as scheduled. Separation from Service does not affect payment form or timing.\nn If the Participant elected a specified date but separates from service prior to that date OR if the Participant\nelected to be paid at retirement\no If the Participant elected lump sum, paid in a lump sum on the later of July 1, 2017 or the first January 1 or\nJuly 1 that is at least six months after the Separation from Service date.\no If the Participant elected installments, the first installment is paid on the later of July 1, 2017 or the July 1 of the calendar year following the Separation from Service date, and subsequent installments will be paid on each July 1 thereafter.\nn If the Participant dies, the usual death benefit rules for Post-2010 Deferral Benefits apply\n55-\nSCHEDULE D\nThe Plan is hereby irrevocably terminated, effective as of and contingent on the closing of the transactions described in the Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. and a subsidiary of Time Inc. (the “Termination Date”), solely with respect to the Participants in the Plan who are employees of American Express Publishing Corporation on the Termination Date (“Publishing Participants”). As of the Termination Date, all crediting of Plan accounts of Publishing Participants shall cease. Each Publishing Participant’s remaining accrued and unpaid benefits shall be paid to such participant in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) and on a date within twelve months of the Termination Date. The benefit to be paid to each Publishing Participant shall be determined in accordance with the Plan’s provisions. All benefits under the Plan shall be paid only in a manner that complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n56-\nSCHEDULE E\nAmerican Express Global Business Travel Divestiture\nEffective upon the establishment of the proposed joint venture involving the Global Business Travel business (as it may be defined in one or more documents governing the joint venture) (the “Business”), this Schedule shall govern Plan participation by individuals who are Participants in this Plan and who as of or after the establishment of the Business are or become employees of one or more entities forming part of the Business under circumstances in which the documents governing the Business obligate the Business to provide such individuals with benefits comparable to those offered by the Company for some period of time (a “Business Employee”). In the event of any conflict between this Schedule E and other provisions of the Plan, this Schedule shall control for Business Employees; provided, however, that nothing in this Schedule shall affect the time of payment, form of payment or amount of benefits accrued prior to the date this Schedule becomes applicable to a Participant, or the Participant’s other rights and obligations with respect to such benefits.\nARTICLE 1 CONTINUED PARTICIPATION\nSection 1.1 Eligibility to Participate. A Business Employee may continue to participate in this Plan during such period as may be established under the documents governing the Business as the period during which the Business Employee will receive benefits comparable to those offered by the Company.\n(a) In order to be entitled to participate, the Business Employee must have been a Participant in the Plan immediately prior to the establishment of the Business (or, if later, the date the employee became a Business Employee) (in either case, the Business Employee’s “Transition Date”), or must have been offered the opportunity to enroll prior to his or her Transition Date and must either have enrolled in the Plan prior to the Transition Date or after the Transition Date but prior to the enrollment deadline that would have applied if the Business Employee had remained an Employee of the Company.\n(b) The Administrator retains the discretion to decline to permit continued participation by any Business Employee,\nso long as such exclusion does not cause a violation of Section 409A.\n(c) Participation under this Schedule is intended to be limited to a select group of management or highly\ncompensated employees, so as to maintain the qualification of the Plan as a “top-hat” plan for purposes of ERISA.\nSection 1.2 Termination of Participation. A Business Employee’s ability to continue to make and receive contributions under the Plan will terminate as of the earlier of:\n(a) The date the Business Employee has a Separation from Service from the Business (or such later date as is required by Section 409A), provided that an individual who is rehired prior to termination of participation under paragraph (b) below may resume participation in accordance with the terms of the Plan, this Schedule and Section 409A;\n57-\n(b) The later of the following dates (which dates and hence the applicable time of termination of participation may\ndiffer for different types of contributions):\n(i) The end of the period during which comparable benefits are required under the documents governing\nthe Business; or\n(ii) The date cessation of contributions is permissible under Section 409A.\nSection 1.3 Change of Status. An individual who was a Business Employee but who again becomes an Employee of the Company will cease to have participation in the Plan governed by this Schedule, except for benefits attributable to his or her time as a Business Employee, and provided that this change in status will not invalidate any elections filed as a Business Employee.\nARTICLE 2 CONTRIBUTIONS\nSection 2.1 Deferral Benefits. Deferral Benefits will be deducted from each participating Business Employee’s Base Salary and Incentive Pay in accordance with the Business Employee’s timely filed Deferral Election and the following rules:\n(a) The term “Base Salary” shall be deemed to include amounts paid by the Business that correspond on the relevant payroll system to amounts which would be “Base Salary” if paid by the Company to an Employee, determined in compliance with applicable law.\n(b) The term “Incentive Pay” shall be deemed to include amounts paid by the Business that correspond on the relevant payroll system to amounts which would be “Incentive Pay” if paid by the Company to an Employee, determined in compliance with applicable law.\n(c) For purposes of determining whether any Deferral Election that takes effect after the Participant reaches the Section 401(a)(17) Limitation has been activated, compensation from the Company and the Business will be aggregated unless otherwise required by law.\n(d) A Business Employee’s Deferral Elections filed prior to the individual’s becoming a Business Employee shall not be affected by the individual’s change in status to a Business Employee. A Business Employee may not file a new Deferral Election after his or her participation ceases in accordance with Article 1 of this Schedule (without prejudice to the Business Employee’s rights under Article 1 of this Schedule to resume participation and file any appropriate Deferral Elections upon qualifying to do so again).\nSection 2.2 Supplemental Benefits. Supplemental Benefits may be allocated to a Business Employee’s RSP-Related Account in such amounts as Amex may determine, in its sole discretion. Without limiting Amex’s discretion under the foregoing, Amex is expressly authorized to take into account amounts paid by the Business when calculating Supplemental Benefits for a Business Employee attributable to periods after the establishment of the Business.\nSection 2.3 No Duplication. Nothing herein entitles any Business Employee or other person to duplicative benefits.\n58-\nSection 2.4 Funding of Benefits. Benefits under the Plan shall at all times be unfunded obligations of the Company, without prejudice to the Company’s right to require the Business to provide it (or any rabbi trust established under the Plan) with such payments as may be agreed between the Company and the Business from time to time. No such agreement may give the Plan, any Participant or any Beneficiary a right to any such funds or to payment of Plan benefits in preference to the general creditors of the Business, and any amounts paid to the Company (or any rabbi trust established under the Plan) by the Business with respect to the Plan shall remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Business to the extent necessary to preserve the unfunded nature of the Plan.\nARTICLE 3 VESTING\nVesting of benefits shall be determined in the same fashion as if employment with the Business were employment with the Company, and the vesting of contributions shall be accelerated to the extent the vesting of similar contributions is accelerated under the RSP with respect to Business Employees; provided, however, that with respect to Company contributions attributable to employment with the Business, the normal vesting schedule applicable to comparable contributions under the Business’ 401(k) plan shall apply and vesting will not be accelerated.\nARTICLE 4 EARNINGS\nCredits to a Participant’s Deferral Account and RSP-Related Account with respect to benefits earned while a Business Employee shall be made in accordance with Article 7 of the Plan.\nARTICLE 5 PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\nSection 5.1 Normal Time and Form of Payment. The time and form of payment for a Business Employee shall be determined as if employment with the Business were employment with the Company, and a Participant shall not experience a Separation from Service merely on account of employment with the Business instead of the Company, unless otherwise provided by Section 409A. A Participant shall not be treated as commencing a new period of participation in the Plan merely because of employment with the Business instead of the Company, although a Participant who Separates from Service from the Business and subsequently is rehired shall be subject to the normal rules for rehires (as expressly modified by this Schedule E, if applicable to the Participant upon rehire).\nSection 5.2 Separation from Service. Once a Participant becomes a Business Employee, the occurrence of a Separation from Service shall be determined by treating the Business (along with any affiliates of the Business treated as a single employer with the Business under Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code, using the 80 percent common ownership standard) as the “service recipient.” (In the event of any future transactions involving the Business or other events which may require alteration of the definition of “service recipient,” the application of the Separation from Service rules shall be adjusted as necessary to continue to comply with\n59-\nSection 409A.) If the Participant subsequently again becomes an Employee of the Company, benefits attributable to the Participant’s reemployment by the Company shall be governed by the Plan’s normal rules regarding Separation from Service, but benefits attributable to periods during and prior to the Participant’s employment as a Business Employee shall continue to be governed by this Section.\nSection 5.3 Beneficiaries. A Participant’s designation of a Beneficiary will not be affected merely because the Participant becomes a Business Employee.\nARTICLE 6 MISCELLANEOUS\nSection 6.1 Reservation of Rights. The Committee reserves the right to amend or terminate this Schedule or any other part of the Plan at any time, without the approval of any individual (including Business Employees), subject to compliance with Section 409A.\nSection 6.2 Scope of Schedule. Nothing in this Schedule gives any Business Employee or any other individual a right to payment of benefits superior to that of any other Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, or the right to be hired by or remain in the employ of the Company, the Business or any affiliate of either. Nothing in the Plan or this Schedule is intended to create any third- party beneficiary rights under the documents governing the establishment of the Business.\nSection 6.3 Construction. The Administrator shall have the right to construe, interpret and administer this Schedule to the same extent as the rest of the Plan, and to decide any claims arising from this Schedule pursuant to the Plan’s normal claims process. This Schedule constitutes part of the Plan and shall at all times be interpreted in a manner compliant with Section 409A.\n60-\nEXHIBIT 10.22\nDESCRIPTION OF COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS\nUpon the recommenda\u0000on of the Nomina\u0000ng and Governance Commi\u0000ee of the Board of Directors of American Express Company, on December 7, 2021, the Board approved the payment of the following compensa\u0000on to each non-management director of the Board in respect of his/her service on the Board eﬀec\u0000ve January 1, 2022:\n\nan annual retainer of $110,000; provided that this amount shall be reduced by $20,000 if the Director does not a\u0000end at least 75% of the mee\u0000ngs of the Board and mee\u0000ngs of the commi\u0000ees on which the Director serves;\n\na grant of Share Equivalent Units having a value of $220,000 to be awarded under the 2003 Share Equivalent Unit Plan for Directors upon the Director’s elec\u0000on or reelec\u0000on to the Board at the Annual Mee\u0000ng of Shareholders;\n\nan annual retainer of $40,000 for the chairs of the Audit and Compliance Commi\u0000ee and the Risk Commi\u0000ee, and an annual retainer of $30,000 for the chairs of the Compensa\u0000on and Beneﬁts Commi\u0000ee and the Nomina\u0000ng, Governance and Public Responsibility Commi\u0000ee;\n\nan annual retainer of $20,000 for each member of the Audit and Compliance Commi\u0000ee and the Risk Commi\u0000ee, and an annual retainer of $15,000 for each member of the Compensa\u0000on and Beneﬁts Commi\u0000ee, and the Nomina\u0000ng, Governance and Public Responsibility Commi\u0000ee;\n\nan annual lead director fee of $100,000 (delivered as $25,000 in cash and $75,000 in Share Equivalent Units); and\n\nreimbursement of customary expenses for a\u0000ending Board, commi\u0000ee, and shareholder mee\u0000ngs.\nEXHIBIT 10.31\nAMENDMENT TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT (BAND 99) AND NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT (BAND 99)\nI.

        "predicted": "According to Passage 4, the details of cash flows from the statement of cash flows for FY2020 are as follows:\n\n- Net cash provided by operating activities: $1,426 million\n- Net cash used in investing activities: $2,061 million\n- Net cash provided by financing activities: $1,120 million\n\nWe need to find the cash dividends paid out. The statement of cash flows does not directly mention the cash dividends. However, we can find the information in the consolidated balance sheet (Passage 6). The change in retained earnings (accumulated deficit) is provided in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFrom Passage 6, we can see that the retained earnings (accumulated deficit) for 2020 is $18,232 million and for 2019 is $18,232 - $18,232 + $18,232 = $18,232 - $18,232 + $18,232 = $18,232 million for 2018 is not needed as we are calculating for 2019 to 2020. The change in retained earnings is $19,710 - $18,232 = $1,478 million.\n\nHowever, this change in retained earnings also includes other comprehensive income (loss). To find the cash dividends, we need to find the net income attributable to common shareholders, which is $709 million for 2020 (Passage 1).\n\nThe change in retained earnings ($1,478 million) is equal to net income ($709 million) plus dividends paid plus other comprehensive income (loss). We don't have the other comprehensive income (loss) for 2020 directly, but we can find it in Passage 2, which states that comprehensive income attributable to common shareholders for 2020 is $696 million, and net income attributable to common shareholders is $709 million. The difference between comprehensive income and net income is other comprehensive income (loss). So, other comprehensive income (loss) is $709 - $696 = $13 million.\n\nNow, we can find the dividends paid. The change in retained earnings is $1,478 million, which is equal to net income ($709 million) plus other comprehensive income (loss) ($13 million) plus dividends paid. So, dividends paid are $1,478 - $709 - $13 = $756 million.\n\nConverting this to billions, $756 million is equal to $0.756 billion.",

        "predicted": "To determine if American Water Works has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, we need to calculate the working capital.\n\nWorking capital is typically calculated as the difference between current assets and current liabilities. However, the provided data does not explicitly show current liabilities for FY2022. \n\nHowever, we can use the information from the balance sheet (Passage 5) to estimate the working capital. \n\nCurrent assets for FY2022 are $23,223 million (from Passage 5) and current liabilities are not explicitly shown, but we can calculate total liabilities from the balance sheet. Total liabilities for FY2022 are $27,787 million (from Passage 6), and total equity is $9,292 million (calculated from Passage 3 and Passage 5). So, current liabilities would be $27,787 - $9,292 = $18,495 million. \n\nNow, we can calculate working capital: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities = $23,223 - $18,495 ≈ $4,728 million.\n\nSince the calculated working capital is positive, American Water Works has positive working capital based on FY2022 data.\n\nHowever, working capital might not be a useful or relevant metric for this company because it is a water utility company with a large amount of fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment) and long-term liabilities (e.g., long-term debt). In such cases, cash flow and debt metrics might be more relevant for evaluating the company's financial health.",

Business.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.\nDescription of Business\nWe were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nSegments and Geographic Areas\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”) and Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”).\nOperations\nOur Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate an omnichannel platform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.\nDevelopment of merchandise and service offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance, information technology and real estate management) operate from our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in- home teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics. While day-to-day operations of our stores are led by store management, more strategic decisions regarding, for example, store locations, format, category assortment and fulfillment strategy are addressed at a market or regional level.\nOur Best Buy Health business has a dedicated leadership team and operations team. The Best Buy Health leadership team manages the day-to-day affairs of all aspects of its business, while receiving support from certain Best Buy enterprise capabilities.\nMerchandise and Services\nOur Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories. The key components of each revenue category are as follows:\n\n\n\n·\nComputing and Mobile Phones - computing (including desktops, notebooks and peripherals), mobile phones (including related mobile network carrier commissions), networking, tablets (including e-readers) and wearables (including smartwatches); Consumer Electronics - digital imaging, health and fitness products, home theater, portable audio (including headphones and portable speakers) and smart home; Appliances - large appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including blenders, coffee makers and vacuums); Entertainment - drones, gaming (including hardware, peripherals and software), movies, music, toys, virtual reality and other software; Services - consultation, delivery, design, health-related services, installation, memberships, repair, set-up, technical support and warranty-related services; and\nOther - other product offerings, including baby, food and beverage, luggage, outdoor living and sporting goods.\n4\nDistribution\nCustomers within our Domestic and International segments who purchase product online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curbside pick-up for select products at most Domestic stores), at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers.\nSuppliers and Inventory\nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony – representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives, and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.\nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products.\nStore Development\nWe had 1,138 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel strategy, and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations.\nRefer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and trade names, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Essentials, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Mobile, Best Buy Totaltech, CST, Current Health, Dynex, Geek Squad, Insignia, Jitterbug, Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Pacific Sales, Platinum, Rocketfish, TechLiquidators, Yardbird and our Yellow Tag logo.\nWe have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.\nSeasonality\nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\nWorking Capital\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\nCompetition\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in our stores and in their homes, and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs, provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our broad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs; our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.\n5\nEnvironmental and Social\nAs we pursue our purpose to enrich lives through technology, we are committed to having a positive impact on the world, the environment and the communities in which we operate through interactions with all of our stakeholders, including our customers, employees, vendor partners and shareholders.\nThe Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) advises and oversees management regarding the effectiveness and risks of our environmental, social and governance strategy, programs and initiatives, including environmental goals and progress, social responsibility programs, and initiatives and public policy positions and advocacy.\nEnvironmental\nWe aspire to drive forward the circular economy and we are committed to conserving natural resources, reducing waste in our operations, offering products that help our customers live more sustainably and transitioning to renewable energy sources. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we have invested in five solar fields, helping to accelerate the progress towards our carbon reduction goals.\nWe intend to reduce the use of natural resources in our operations as demonstrated by the following goals, which we believe can be managed within our normal operating budget without significant incremental spending:\n\n\n\nReduce carbon emissions 75% by 2030 (over a 2009 baseline) and become carbon neutral by 2040. We continue to reduce our carbon emissions and plan to achieve this goal by investing in energy efficiency improvements, deploying small-scale onsite and utility-scale renewable energy systems, electrifying our fleet and neutralizing residual emissions. Reduce water consumption 15% by 2025 (over a 2019 baseline). By monitoring our water consumption across our business, and identifying actions that lessen our dependence on water, we continue to reduce our water usage. Achieve zero-waste certification at additional distribution center locations. To continue reducing our impact on the environment, we are working toward building a more sustainable supply chain and expanding our Total Resource Use and Efficiency zero-waste certification efforts across our warehousing operations.\nWe aim to help our customers reduce their impact on the environment as well. Through the sale of ENERGY STAR® products, we expect to help our customers reduce carbon emissions 20% by 2030 (over a 2017 baseline), which we estimate will save our customers collectively at least $5 billion on utility bills.\nWe support the circular economy by keeping consumer products in use for as long as possible through our repair and trade-in services. Finally, we put materials back into the manufacturing process when products reach the end of their lives through our electronics and appliance recycling program. We have collected more than 2.7 billion pounds of electronics and appliances for recycling since 2009, including more than 183 million pounds in fiscal 2023. We remain committed to maintaining this program to collect even more in the years ahead.\nSocial\nHuman Rights and Responsible Sourcing\nWe are committed to respecting and advancing human rights through our alignment with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Further, across all the products and services we procure, we seek to enhance our partnership with suppliers and create value for all stakeholders through our Responsible Sourcing Program. We are active members of the Responsible Business Alliance, which allows us to partner with many of the brands we sell, including Apple, Intel, Microsoft and Samsung. Collectively, we embrace a common Supplier Code of Conduct and audit methodology that seeks to improve working and environmental conditions in the supply chain.\nCommunity Impact\nThe Best Buy Foundation is working to build brighter futures for teens from disinvested communities. The Best Buy Foundation currently supports a network of 52 Best Buy Teen Tech Center® locations and has a goal of supporting 100 locations by 2025. Through the Best Buy Teen Tech Centers and a suite of supporting programs, teens are able to prepare for careers of the future through access to:\n· · mentors who inspire new passions and possibilities; · ·\ncutting-edge technology and related training; post-secondary guidance for college prep and technical programs;\nsocial and emotional support, including mental health resources; and paid internship and career exploration opportunities that put learning into practice.\n6\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe in the power of our people. Our culture is built on the belief that engaged and committed employees – supported by opportunities to learn, grow, innovate and explore – can lead to extraordinary outcomes. At the end of fiscal 2023, we employed more than 90,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada, comprised of approximately 58% full-time employees, 32% part-time employees and 10% seasonal/occasional employees.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are creating a more inclusive future, both inside our company and in our communities. In fiscal 2021, we set employee diversity goals to be attained by 2025, and we are pleased to report the following achievements in fiscal 2023:\n\n\nfilled 37% of new, salaried corporate positions with Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) employees, compared to our goal to fill one of three positions; and filled 25% of new, salaried field positions with female employees, compared to our goal to fill one of three positions.\nWe are committed to creating a stronger community of diverse suppliers to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. We continue making progress on our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. In addition, we are investing up to $10 million with Brown Venture Group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on Black, Latino and Indigenous technology startups in emerging technologies.\nFor our communities, we continue making progress on our commitment to spend $44 million by 2025 to expand college preparation and career opportunities for BIPOC students, including adding scholarships for Historically Black Colleges and University students and increasing scholarship funding for Best Buy Teen Tech Center youth.\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board supports the development of an inclusive and diverse culture through oversight of our human resources policies and program. The Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee of our Board recommends criteria for the selection of individuals to be considered as candidates for election to the Board, which includes diversity considerations.\nTraining and Development\nPersonal growth is at the heart of our people strategy, and we believe investing in training, upskilling and reskilling programs will produce long-lasting benefits to the organization by creating a more productive, engaged and adaptable workforce. In fiscal 2023, each of our U.S. employees spent an average of at least 44 hours on training and development.\nWe made the following enhancements to our training and development program in fiscal 2023:\n\n· ·\nexpanded our leadership development program to all field and corporate leaders and directors across the enterprise with a focus on adaptability, the ability to work effectively with others and create a culture of belonging, the ability to apply reason and learning experiences into one’s role, and the ability to understand and thrive in a digital economy; launched a program with an artificial intelligence platform to proactively plan for future workforce roles, creating new learning and career paths; provided LinkedIn Learning to full-time employees for continuous learning in leadership and functional skills; and created a new onboarding training program for all new employees to create a consistent experience that starts their unique learning path specific for their job.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe strive to help our employees live happy, healthy and productive lives that balances work and home.\nOur benefits aim to support employees’ overall well-being. In fiscal 2023, we elevated caregiver support for employees with a focus on disabilities and neurodivergence through a partnership with Joshin.\nAdditionally, we continued our focus on:\n\ncaregiver support benefits that enable employees to receive personalized help in a time of great need through Wellthy, a program that helps employees with emergency housing, healthcare, substance abuse, complex eldercare issues and other moments of crisis; pay continuation (paid leave) and caregiver pay so employees can care for themselves and their loved ones;\n· maternity leave that provides qualifying employees up to 10 weeks at 100% pay; ·\nIncluded Health – a new benefit providing support for employees with a focus on LGBTQ+ needs that connect members to affirming and clinically competent providers, and one-on-one support with a care coordinator; access to physical and mental health virtual visits; emergency assistance through the HOPE Fund – Helping Our People in Emergencies – in equal partnership with the Richard M. Schultze Family Foundation, provides employees in hardship situations an opportunity to receive up to $2,500 in financial assistance;\n·\n7\n· mental health, including our commitment to raise awareness about mental health, equipping employees with training to notice issues in themselves or\n\nothers, and then find help; and tuition assistance, including the expansion of our partnership schools giving eligible employees the opportunity to earn a degree with no out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board oversees risks related to our human capital management through its regular review of our practices, policies and programs, which includes overall employee wellness and engagement in these areas, employee benefit plan compliance, leadership succession planning and wage, retention and hiring programs.\nFor more information on environmental and social matters, as well as human capital management, please see Best Buy’s Fiscal 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, including a Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures index, expected to be published in June 2023, at https://corporate.bestbuy.com/sustainability.

Risk Factors.\nDescribed below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. Each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\n8\nExternal Risks\nMacroeconomic pressures, including, but not limited to, the current geopolitical climate, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.\nTo varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:\nwhether or not they make a purchase; • • •\ntheir choice of brand, model or price-point; how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and their appetite for complementary services (for example, Best Buy Totaltech).\nReal GDP growth, inflation (including wage inflation), consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels, oil prices, interest, tax and foreign currency exchange rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, limitations on a government’s ability to borrow and/or spend capital, costs for items such as fuel and food, any recession (and resulting corresponding declines in consumer sentiment) in response at least in part to central banks’ actions to reduce inflation, bank failures or limited liquidity in accessing bank deposits, and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. We may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures.\nGeopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. For example, the conflict in Ukraine may continue to significantly impact fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions, which may further adversely affect global economic growth, consumer confidence and demand for our products and services. Russia is a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. Disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by Russia, whether due to sanctions, market pressure not to purchase inputs from Russia or otherwise, could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell. We cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine, nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of Russia, its allies or other countries with which Russia has significant trade or financial ties, including China. The conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated geopolitical tensions globally. Further deterioration of relations between Taiwan and China, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with China or political or economic conditions in Taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region, such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from Taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from China. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain, the cost of our products or our revenues and financial results.\nCatastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may consist of, or be caused by, for example:\n• • • •\nnatural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change; diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners; earthquakes, floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; power loss, telecommunications failures, or software or hardware malfunctions; or terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.\nIn recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. They can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require. Finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in particular has had and may continue to subject our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks. These risks have included or may in the future continue to include: (i) significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores; (ii) significant disruptions to our supply chain; (iii) fluctuating consumer spending, particularly in light of the provision of government stimulus funds; (iv) novel changes to our operations, such as the roll-out of contactless, curbside pick-up for our goods, (v) the implementation of safety standards by various state and federal agencies; (vi) risks related to the shift in channels in which customers choose to engage us, such as by switching to online shopping, which may affect our profitability; and (vii) our ability to finance our operations. The emergence of new and more transmissible, more virulent, and/or immune-evading SARS-COV-2 variants could exacerbate these risks.\n9\nThree of our largest states by total sales are California, Texas and Florida, areas where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions have been, and could continue to be, more prevalent. Natural disasters and climate-related events in those states and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of our stores, distribution centers or other facilities.\nFurther, external social activism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. Also, if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nMany of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.\nWe operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technological innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, the often rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, changing price points, and product replacement and upgrade cycles.\nThis rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nStrategic Risks\nWe face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.\nWhile we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.\nThe retail sector continues to experience increased sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick- up. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. In addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.\nWe operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We may also be subject to continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates and increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. Our need to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business.\n10\nOur strategy to expand into health and new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.\nAs we introduce new products and services, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology and regulatory challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues.\nThis expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.\nWith our focus on healthcare, new products and services may frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction. The number and diversity of regulatory bodies add complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs. For example, the healthcare space in which we operate is highly regulated from a product safety and quality perspective, and its services and products, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, orders to stop providing services, fines or claims for damages. Product safety incidents or user concerns could trigger business reviews by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger these impacts.\nIn addition, the ongoing digitalization of Best Buy Health’s products and services, including our holding of personal health data and medical data, increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws. The services and systems used in certain instances subject us to privacy and information security requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. Given our acquisition of Current Health, a care-at-home technology platform, we also are subject to the UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other regulatory frameworks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and reputation.\nOur focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability, as well as our reputation.\nWe offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:\n\n•\n•\n• •\n•\n\npressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications; increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises; increased pressure on margins from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering, which includes incremental customer benefits, and associated costs, compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and the risk that increased volumes will not fully compensate for lower margins, or for loss of revenue and profit from revenue streams that are now included as benefits; pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs; use of third-party services that do not meet our standards or comply with applicable labor and independent contractor regulations, leading to potential reputational damage and liability risk; increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services; unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses; employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability; the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings; employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold; the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake; the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.\n•\n11\nOur reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony - representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor- focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages ¾ for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers ¾ to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.\nWe are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.\nDemand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience.\nWe operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. Third parties may commit fraud while using our brand without our permission, possibly harming brand perception or reputation. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nFailure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, “new ventures”). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:\n• • • • • • • •\ndifferent and incremental business and other risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments; failure to attract, motivate and retain key employees of the new venture; uncertainty of forecasting financial performance; failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems; failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting; failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions; unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture; disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other third-party participants in the new venture; and adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.\nIf new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management’s attention from other important areas of our business.\n12\nFailure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.\nEffective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased under multi-year contracts. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:\n• • • • • • •\nchanging patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment; our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns; the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio; the interior layout, format and size of our stores; the products and services we offer at each store; the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores; the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents.\nIf we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:\n• • •\nclosing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases; incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores; operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and bearing excessive lease expenses.\nThese consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nFor leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.\nOperational Risks\nInterruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.\nOur stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:\n• • • • • • • •\n•\ninterruptions to our delivery capabilities; failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments; disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems; limitations in capacity; global supply chain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing; increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage; risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities; consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors; labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain; diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns; and increasing transportation costs.\nIt is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.\n13\nWe utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationships or their services may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, delivery and installation, customer warranty, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, technical support, transportation, insurance programs and human resource operations. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.\nOur exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.\nSales of our exclusive brands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and Southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:\nwe have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;\nwe may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;\nwe have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics, unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine and this conflict’s potential impact on global geopolitical tensions, including with China or between China and Taiwan;\nwe may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;\nwe may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights; • we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;\nwe may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual\n\nproperty rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products; our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply; and\nwe may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes.\nMaintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them.\nWe are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.\nOur ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment (including, for example, our Urgent Response service provided by Best Buy Health), staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.\n14\nOur information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions, including ransomware and phishing attacks), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. While we have adopted, and continue to enhance, business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies, there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective, which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers, cloud platforms or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.\nAs we continue to migrate more systems to the cloud, we may face additional risks that may compromise our security or disrupt our business capabilities, including ensuring the proper configuration, the unknowns of operating more workloads in the cloud, securing systems in the cloud and the types of cloud-based services we leverage.\nWe face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.\nWe utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks by governments, criminals or other non-state actors, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues and incur material costs, and could adversely affect our reputation.\nFurther, as our online interactions and sales have increased and have become critical to our growth, and as many employees now use hybrid or full-time remote- working arrangements, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations. Any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.\nFailure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.\nOur business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information and protected health information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which process and transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner or otherwise seek to extract financial gain based on access to or possession of company, employee or customer information. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, and given the potentially disruptive nature of emerging technologies, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.\nSensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.\nIncreasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, recently applicable and potential new or significantly revised state, provincial and federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business are expanding our obligations to protect and honor the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach or compliance failure. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nProduct safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nIf the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\n15\nChanges to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.\nAs an employer of more than 90,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:\n\n\n\nthe organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers; laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; and laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.\nChanges to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:\n•\n\n\n\n•\nthe difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions; the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials; the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport; the financial, operational and business impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or sharing of information; consumer rights to access, delete or limit/opt-out of the use of information; or litigation arising from new private rights of action; the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure; the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies.\nThe impact of geopolitical tensions, including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, political or trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects.\nFurther, the impact of potential changes in U.S., state or other countries’ tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters.\nConcern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, compliance, transportation and utility cost increases. Our own climate change-oriented initiatives, such as our attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling, could also increase our costs. In addition, changes to the environment, both long-term and short-term, may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue, revenue mix and profitability.\n16\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s recently proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nOur international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.\nWe operate retail locations in Canada, Current Health operates in the UK, and most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly-owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the UK. During fiscal 2023, our International segment’s operations generated approximately 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:\n• • •\n• • •\npolitical conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism; economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk; rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities; government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events; cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately; different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions; difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.\nThese factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nAs discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors’ because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.\nWe are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\nA large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems, or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.\n17\nEconomic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.\nWe offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2023 revenue was transacted using one of the company’s branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.\nConstraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nWe need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. We typically hold material balances of cash, cash equivalents and/or short-term investments and are therefore reliant on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to these assets. Our future liquidity will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for and financial stability of banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.\nChanges in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.\nAny future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.\nFailure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. When we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nItem 1B.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information and Dividends\nOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol BBY. In fiscal 2004, our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend with respect to shares of our common stock. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter. On March 2, 2023, we announced an increase in our regular quarterly dividend from $0.88 per share to $0.92 per share. Future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our Board.\nHolders\nAs of March 15, 2023, there were 1,955 holders of record of our common stock.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nOn February 28, 2022, our Board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on February 16, 2021. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased and retired 11.8 million shares at a cost of $1.0 billion. For additional information, see “Share Repurchases and Dividends” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 9, Shareholders’ Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n21\nInformation regarding our repurchases of common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was as follows:\nPeriod\nOct. 30, 2022 through Nov. 26, 2022 Nov. 27, 2022 through Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2023 through Jan. 28, 2023 Total fiscal 2023 fourth quarter\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased\n3,558,147 3,580,328 - 7,138,475\n$ $ $ $\nAverage Price Paid per Share\n71.60 82.18 - 76.91\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program\n3,558,147 3,580,328 - 7,138,475\n$ $ $ $\nApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program 4,419,000,000 4,125,000,000 4,125,000,000 4,125,000,000\nBest Buy Stock Comparative Performance Graph\nThe information contained in this Best Buy Stock Comparative Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or “filed” or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (“S&P 500”), of which we are a component, and the Standard & Poor's Retailing Group Industry Index (“S&P Retailing Group”), of which we are also a component.

[Reserved].\n22\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended January 29, 2022, compared to the year ended January 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.\nComparable Sales\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). All periods presented apply this methodology consistently.\nOn November 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”). On November 4, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”). Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of Current Health and Yardbird are excluded from our comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non- GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\n23\nIn our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the presented periods.\nBusiness Strategy Update\nDuring fiscal 2023, our team delivered strong execution and relentless focus on customer service during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry. Throughout the fiscal year, we remained committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance.\nDuring the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality, and to lead not follow.\nIn fiscal 2023, digital sales comprised 33% of our Domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. Not only was 67% of our Domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engaged in cross-channel shopping experiences, and more than 40% of online sales were picked up in stores. Further, we play an important role for our vendors as the only national consumer electronics specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. Therefore, we are focused on evolving our omnichannel retail strategy over time, including our portfolio of stores, operating model and digital tools, to provide customers with differentiated experiences and enhance our omnichannel fulfillment.\nWe continue to advance our other strategic initiatives as well. We are building customer relationships through membership, including evolving our free My Best Buy program and our paid Best Buy Totaltech membership option. In Best Buy Health, we are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging Best Buy’s core assets, including the Geek Squad, to grow, build and establish the Care at Home space, an emerging part of the healthcare industry.\nAs we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued pressure, and we are preparing for sales in the consumer electronics industry to decline again this year. In particular, our customers are facing economic challenges from the dual pressures of high inflation and the resulting interest rate increases, and it is difficult to predict how such factors will impact us in the near term. However, we expect several factors to drive the eventual return of industry growth over time, including the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought earlier in the pandemic and continued vendor innovation. In addition, macro technology trends like cloud, augmented reality and expanded broadband access have the potential to drive new products and demand. While our product categories tend to experience slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging.\nWe remain excited about our industry and our future. There are more technology products than ever in people’s homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we believe we are uniquely there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space.\n24\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nSelected consolidated financial data was as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\nConsolidated Performance Summary Revenue Revenue % change Comparable sales % change Gross profit Gross profit as a % of revenue(1) SG&A SG&A as a % of revenue(1) Restructuring charges Operating income Operating income as a % of revenue Net earnings Diluted earnings per share\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$ $\n2023\n46,298\n(10.6)% (9.9)%\n9,912\n21.4 %\n7,970\n17.2 % 147 1,795\n3.9 %\n1,419 6.29\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$ $\n2022\n51,761\n9.5 % 10.4 %\n11,640\n22.5 %\n8,635\n16.7 % (34) 3,039\n5.9 %\n2,454 9.84\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$ $\n(1)\nBecause retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn fiscal 2023, we generated $46.3 billion in revenue and our comparable sales declined 9.9%. Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at- home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand within the consumer electronics industry.\nRevenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment. For further discussion of each segment’s rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.\nSegment Performance Summary\nDomestic Segment\nSelected financial data for the Domestic segment was as follows ($ in millions):\nDomestic Segment Performance Summary Revenue Revenue % change Comparable sales % change(1) Gross profit Gross profit as a % of revenue SG&A SG&A as a % of revenue Restructuring charges Operating income Operating income as a % of revenue Selected Online Revenue Data Total online revenue Online revenue as a % of total segment revenue Comparable online sales% change(1) (1) Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$\n2023\n42,794\n(10.5)% (10.3)% 9,106\n21.3 %\n7,332\n17.1 % 140 1,634\n3.8 %\n14,212\n33.2 % (13.5)%\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$\n2022\n47,830\n10.5 % 11.0 %\n10,702\n22.4 %\n7,946\n16.6 % (39) 2,795\n5.8 %\n16,430\n34.4 % (12.0)%\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n$\nThe decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories, particularly computing, home theater, mobile phones and appliances. Online revenue of $14.2 billion decreased 13.5% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2023. These decreases in revenue were primarily due to the reasons described within the Consolidated Results section, above.\n25\n2021\n2021\n47,262\n8.3 % 9.7 %\n10,573\n22.4 %\n7,928\n16.8 % 254 2,391\n5.1 %\n1,798 6.84\n43,293\n7.9 % 9.2 %\n9,720\n22.5 %\n7,239\n16.7 % 133 2,348\n5.4 %\n18,674\n43.1 % 144.4 %\nDomestic segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:\nBest Buy Outlet Centers Pacific Sales Yardbird Total Domestic segment stores\n2021 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year 956 14 21 - 991\nStores Opened\n2 2 - 9 13\n2022\nStores Closed(1)\n(20) - - - (20)\nTotal Stores at End of Fiscal Year 938 16 21 9 984\nStores Opened\n1 3 - 5 9\n2023\nStores Closed\n(14) - (1) - (15)\n(1)\nExcludes stores that were temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy.

In fiscal 2024, we currently expect to close approximately 20 to 30 Best Buy stores and to increase the number of Outlet Centers to approximately 30.\nDomestic segment revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category were as follows:\nRevenue Mix Summary\nComparable Sales Summary\n2023\n2022\n2023\nComputing and Mobile Phones Consumer Electronics Appliances Entertainment Services Other Total\n43 % 30 % 15 % 6 % 5 % 1 % 100 %\n44 % 31 % 14 % 6 % 5 % -% 100 %\n(12.0)% (12.2)% (5.7)% (5.5)% (2.5)% 1.6 % (10.3)%\nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 12.0% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones, wearables and tablets. • Consumer Electronics: The 12.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, digital imaging and headphones. • Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances. • Entertainment: The 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software. • Services: The 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering that includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.\nOur gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and higher supply chain costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above and decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate.\n26\nTotal Stores at End of Fiscal Year 925 19 20 14 978\n2022\n5.1 % 15.9 % 24.1 % 7.4 % 5.9 % N/A 11.0 %\nInternational Segment\nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\nInternational Segment Performance Summary Revenue Revenue % change Comparable sales % change Gross profit Gross profit as a % of revenue SG&A SG&A as a % of revenue Restructuring charges Operating income Operating income as a % of revenue\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n2023\n3,504 (10.9)% (5.4)% 806 23.0 % 638 18.2 % 7 161 4.6 %\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\n2022\n3,931\n(1.0)% 3.3 % 938 23.9 % 689 17.5 % 5 244 6.2 %\n$\n$\n$\n$ $\nThe decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower sales in Canada due to comparable sales declines across most of our product categories and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nInternational segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n2021 Total Stores at End of Fiscal Year\nStores Opened\n2022\nStores Closed(1)\nTotal Stores at End of Fiscal Year\nStores Opened\n2023\nStores Closed\nCanada Best Buy Best Buy Mobile Mexico Best Buy Best Buy Express Total International segment stores\n131 33\n4 - 168\n-\n- -\n(4) -\n(4) - (8)\n127 33\n- 160\n-\n- -\n-\n- -\n(1)\nExcludes stores that were temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInternational segment revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category were as follows:\nRevenue Mix Summary\nComparable Sales Summary\n2023\n2022\n2023\nComputing and Mobile Phones Consumer Electronics Appliances Entertainment Services Other Total\n45 % 30 % 10 % 8 % 5 % 2 % 100 %\n45 % 30 % 10 % 8 % 5 % 2 % 100 %\n(6.1)% (6.2)% 0.3 % (8.6)% (2.1)% 1.1 % (5.4)%\nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 6.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing and tablets, partially offset by comparable sales growth in mobile phones.\nConsumer Electronics: The 6.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater and health and fitness. • Appliances: The 0.3% comparable sales growth was driven by small appliances. • Entertainment: The 8.6% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by gaming and virtual reality. • Services: The 2.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by warranty services.\nOur gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by lower product margin rates and higher supply chain costs in Canada.\nOur SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates.\nThe restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure.

Our effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to reduced tax benefits from the resolution of tax matters, stock-based compensation and federal tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations of operating income, effective tax rate and diluted EPS (GAAP financial measures) to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS (non-GAAP financial measures), respectively, were as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n2023\n2022\nOperating income % of revenue\nRestructuring - inventory markdowns(1) Price-fixing settlement(2) Intangible asset amortization(3) Restructuring charges(4) Acquisition-related transaction costs(3)\nNon-GAAP operating income % of revenue\n$\n$\n1,795\n3.9 % - - 86\n147 - 2,028\n4.4 %\n$\n$\n3,039\n5.9 % (6) - 82\n(34) 11 3,092\n6.0 %\n$\n$\nEffective tax rate\nPrice-fixing settlement(2) Intangible asset amortization(3) Restructuring charges(4) Gain on investments, net(5) Non-GAAP effective tax rate\n20.7 % -% 0.1 % 0.2 % -% 21.0 %\n19.0 % -% 0.1 % (0.1)% -% 19.0 %\nDiluted EPS\nRestructuring - inventory markdowns(1) Price-fixing settlement(2) Intangible asset amortization(3) Restructuring charges(4) Acquisition-related transaction costs(3) Gain on investments, net(5) Income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(6)\n$\n6.29 - - 0.38 0.65 - - (0.24) 7.08\n$\n9.84 (0.02) - 0.33 (0.14) 0.04 - (0.04) 10.01\n$\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n$\n$\nFor additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 2, Acquisitions; Note 3, Restructuring; Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets; and Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (1) Represents inventory markdowns and subsequent adjustments recorded within cost of sales associated with the exit from operations in Mexico. (2) Represents a price-fixing litigation settlement received in relation to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years. (3) Represents charges associated with acquisitions, including: (1) the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology; and\n(2) acquisition-related transaction and due diligence costs, primarily comprised of professional fees.\n(4) Represents restructuring charges, including: (1) charges in fiscal 2023 associated with an enterprise-wide initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as to\noptimize our cost structure; and (2) charges in fiscal 2021 and subsequent adjustments in fiscal 2022 associated with actions taken in the Domestic segment to better align the company’s organizational structure with its strategic focus and the exit from operations in Mexico in the International segment.\n(5) Represents an increase in the fair value of a minority equity investment in fiscal 2021. (6)\nThe non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S., Canada and Mexico. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 24.5% for the U.S. and 26.4% for Canada applied to the non-GAAP adjustments of each country. There is no income tax charge for Mexico non-GAAP items and a minimal amount of U.S. non-GAAP items, as there was no tax benefit recognized on these expenses in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.\nOur non-GAAP operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by our Domestic segment’s lower gross profit rate and decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to reduced tax benefits from the resolution of tax matters, stock-based compensation and federal tax credits, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.\nOur non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the decrease in non-GAAP operating income, partially offset by lower diluted weighted- average common shares outstanding from share repurchases.\n28\n2021\n2,391\n5.1 % 23 (21) 80\n254 - 2,727\n5.8 %\n24.3 % 0.2 % (0.6)% (1.0)% 0.1 % 23.0 %\n6.84 0.09 (0.08) 0.30 0.97 - (0.05) (0.16) 7.91\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,874\n$\n2,936\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by share repurchases, capital expenditures and dividend payments. These decreases were partially offset by positive cash flows from operations, primarily driven by earnings.\nOur cash deposits held at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. We limit exposure relating to financial instruments by diversifying the financial instruments among various counterparties, which consist primarily of major financial institutions.\nCash Flows\nCash flows were as follows ($ in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities Investing activities Financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\nIncrease (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n$\n1,824 (962) (1,806) (8) (952)\n$\n$\n3,252 (1,372) (4,297) (3) (2,420)\n$\n$\n4,927 (788) (876) 7 3,270\nOperating Activities\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower earnings and higher incentive compensation payments in the current year as a result of strong fiscal 2022 results, partially offset by the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in purchases of investments, partially offset by an increase in capital spending for initiatives to support our business.\nFinancing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower share repurchases.\nSources of Liquidity\nFunds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.\nWe have a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five-Year Facility Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Five- Year Facility Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in May 2026. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as of January 28, 2023, or January 29, 2022.\nOur ability to continue to access the Five-Year Facility Agreement is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as well.\n29\nOur credit ratings and outlook as of March 15, 2023, remained unchanged from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, and are summarized below.\nRating Agency Standard & Poor's Moody's\nRating BBB+ A3\nOutlook Stable Stable\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.\nRestricted Cash\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $379 million and $269 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was primarily due to our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and growth in the membership base, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash for other self-insurance liabilities.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nE-commerce and information technology Store-related projects(1) Supply chain Total capital expenditures(2)\n$\n$\n540 355 35 930\n$\n$\n549 178 10 737\n$\n$\n(1) (2)\nStore-related projects are primarily comprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects. Total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $35 million, $46 million and $32 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable, as well as finance leases.\nWe currently expect capital expenditures to approximate $850 million in fiscal 2024.\nDebt and Capital\nAs of January 28, 2023, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”) and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). Refer to Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our outstanding debt.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nWe repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board. The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.\nOn February 28, 2022, our Board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on February 16, 2021. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.\nShare repurchase and dividend activity were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nTotal cost of shares repurchased Average price per share Total number of shares repurchased Regular quarterly cash dividends per share Cash dividends declared and paid\n$ $\n$ $\n1,001 84.78 11.8 3.52 789\n$ $\n$ $\n3,504 108.97 32.2 2.80 688\n$ $\n$ $\nThe total cost of shares repurchased decreased in fiscal 2023 from decreases in the volume of repurchases and the average price per share.\n30\n539 117 57 713\n318 102.63 3.1 2.20 568\nCash dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share. On March 2, 2023, we announced the Board’s approval of a 5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share.\nOther Financial Measures\nOur current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, remained unchanged at 1.0 as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022. Our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings increased to 0.8 as of January 28, 2023, compared to 0.5 at January 29, 2022, primarily due to lower net earnings.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nWe do not have outstanding off-balance-sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations as of January 28, 2023, were as follows ($ in millions):\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations Purchase obligations(1) Operating lease obligations(2)(3) Long-term debt obligations(4) Interest payments(5) Finance lease obligations(2) Total\n$\n$\nTotal\n3,086 3,033 1,150 241 46 7,556\n$\n$\nLess Than 1 Year\n2,874 707 - 47 16 3,644\n$\n$\n1-3 Years\n188 1,214 - 76 22 1,500\n$\n$\n3-5 Years\n24 729 - 69 4 826\n$\n$\nMore Than 5 Years\n383 1,150 49 4 1,586\nFor additional information regarding the nature of contractual obligations discussed below, refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments; Note 7, Leases; Note 8, Debt; and Note 13, Contingencies and Commitments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (1)\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally, although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments, we included open purchase orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days. Lease obligations exclude $63 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced.\n(2) (3) Operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase total operating lease obligations by\n$0.7 billion as of January 28, 2023.\n(4) Represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments related to our long-term debt obligations. (5)\nInterest payments related to our 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swaps.\nAdditionally, we have $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our Five-Year Facility Agreement as of January 28, 2023, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.\nVendor Allowances\nDescription We receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within SG&A when incurred.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate Due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. These estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including (1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.\n31\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions A 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2023. The level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\nGoodwill\nDescription Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.\nWe have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, respectively, as of January 28, 2023.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) models and market data, such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. DCF models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends.\nEffects if actual results differ from assumptions For our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Compared to fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy’s market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote.\nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. In fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more significantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue growth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the more uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher than for our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit.\nInventory Markdown\nDescription Our merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion as of January 28, 2023. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate Markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions A 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. The level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\nTax Contingencies\nDescription Our income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n32\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nService Revenue\nDescription We sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support, delivery and installation, price discounts on certain products and services, product protection plans and anti-virus software. We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate There is judgment in (1) measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions A 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $40 million in fiscal 2023. The amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous Total Tech Support offer.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in short-term market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates. In addition, we have swapped a portion of our fixed-rate debt to floating rate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short-term interest rates. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments, and Note 8, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our interest rate swaps.\nAs of January 28, 2023, we had $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $500 million of debt that has been swapped to floating rate, and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.8 billion. As of January 28, 2023, a 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $9 million reduction in net interest expense, and conversely a 50-basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $9 million increase in net interest expense.\n33\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to operations in our International segment. On a limited basis, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these instruments.\nDuring fiscal 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar compared to the prior-year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as this foreign currency revenue translated into less U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $162 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net earnings in fiscal 2023 was not significant.\n34\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nManagement's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which conducted its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent registered public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion as to whether such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP\nand that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 28, 2023. During our assessment, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 28, 2023, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an unqualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023.\n35\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. Richfield, Minnesota.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nVendor Allowances — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company receives vendor allowances from certain merchandise vendors through a variety of programs intended to offset the invoice cost of inventory and for promoting and selling merchandise inventory. Allowances based on purchases are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Allowances based on sales volumes are based on merchandise sold and are calculated using an agreed upon amount for each unit sold and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Other promotional allowances not specifically related to volume of purchases or sales, such as advertising and placement, are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor’s products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred.\nGiven the significance of vendor allowances to the financial statements and volume and diversity of the individual vendor agreements, auditing vendor allowances was complex and subjective due to the extent of effort required to evaluate whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and that the allowances deferred as an offset to inventory were complete and accurate.\n36\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to evaluating whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and the completeness and accuracy of deferred vendor allowances included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the recording of vendor allowances, including management's controls over the establishment of vendor arrangements, the calculation of vendor allowances earned, and the determination of the deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory.\nWe selected a sample of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and (1) recalculated the amount recognized using the terms of the vendor agreement; (2) for certain arrangements, confirmed the terms of the agreement directly with the vendor; and (3) evaluated, based on the terms of the agreement, if the amount should be deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory.\nWhere confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to underlying contractual arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.\nWe tested the amount of deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory by developing an expectation for the amount and comparing our expectation to the amount recorded by management.\nGoodwill – Best Buy Health Reporting Unit — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The goodwill balance was $1,383 million as of January 28, 2023, of which $891 million was related to the Best Buy Health reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of cash flows such as revenue growth rates and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of cash flows, such as revenue growth rates, and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of cash flows, such as revenue growth rates and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate.\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts for the new products and services by comparing the forecasts to: (1) the Company’s historical revenue growth rates, including for similar existing products and services; (2) internal communications to management and the board of directors; (3) underlying source documents, when available, such as customer contracts; and (4) underlying analyses detailing business strategies and growth plans.\nWe inquired of operating and sales management teams to determine whether the judgments and assumptions used in the future revenue projections were consistent with the strategy and long-range plans for the Best Buy Health reporting unit.\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital rate by: (1) testing the source information underlying the determination of the rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations; (2) comparing the rate to market data; and (3) developing ranges of independent estimates and comparing those to the rate selected by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMarch 17, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.\n37\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Best Buy Co., Inc. Richfield, Minnesota.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 28, 2023, of the Company and our report dated March 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMarch 17, 2023\n38\nConsolidated Balance Sheets $ in millions, except per share amounts\nAssets Current assets\nCash and cash equivalents Receivables, net Merchandise inventories Other current assets Total current assets Property and equipment\nLand and buildings Leasehold improvements Fixtures and equipment Property under finance leases\nGross property and equipment\nLess accumulated depreciation Net property and equipment\nOperating lease assets Goodwill Other assets Total assets\nLiabilities and equity Current liabilities Accounts payable Unredeemed gift card liabilities Deferred revenue Accrued compensation and related expenses Accrued liabilities Current portion of operating lease liabilities Current portion of long-term debt\nTotal current liabilities\nLong-term operating lease liabilities Long-term liabilities Long-term debt Contingencies and commitments (Note 13) Equity\nBest Buy Co., Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms “Best Buy,” “we,” “us” and “our” in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.\nDescription of Business\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek Squad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, techliquidators.com and yardbird.com. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and our International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”) and Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks.\nSegment Information\nOur business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business) and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada). Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for, and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable segment.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within SG&A.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents Restricted cash included in Other current assets Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n$\n1,874 379 2,253\n$\n$\n2,936 269 3,205\n$\n$\n5,494 131 5,625\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in restricted cash are primarily restricted to use for product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities.\n44\nReceivables\nReceivables consist primarily of amounts due from vendors for various vendor funding programs, banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions, online marketplace partnerships and mobile phone network operators for device sales and commissions. Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for expected credit losses, which is primarily based on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $30 million and $39 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We had $41 million and $52 million of write-offs in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted-average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which includes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of sales on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of inventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis.\nOur inventory valuation reflects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft). Physical inventory is maintained through a combination of full location counts (typically once per year) and more regular cycle counts.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if they are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.\nWhen property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nRepairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.\nCosts associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, generally from two years to five years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software's functionality. Capitalized software is included in Fixtures and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. The costs of developing software for sale to customers are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established, which generally leads to expensing substantially all costs.\nCosts associated with implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are capitalized using methodology similar to internal-use software, but are included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEstimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows (in years):\nAsset Category Buildings Leasehold improvements Fixtures and equipment\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis. For store locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is negative store operating income for the most recent 12-month period. We also monitor other factors when evaluating store locations for impairment, including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies.\n45\nUseful Life 5-35 5-10 2-20\nWhen reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we group long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For example, long-lived assets deployed at store locations are reviewed for impairment at either the individual store level or at the local market level. Such reviews involve comparing the net carrying value of all assets to the net cash flow projections for each store or market. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets shared by several areas of operations, such as information technology systems.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our store operations was a triggering event to review for potential impairments of our store assets. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an immaterial asset impairment charge for a small number of stores within SG&A. No other triggering events were identified for the periods presented.\nLeases\nThe majority of our lease obligations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our finance leases are primarily equipment- related. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it is determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Accounting Standard’s Codification 842, Leases, in fiscal 2020, we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at the commencement date. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on an evaluation of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. Our operating leases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to combine lease and non-lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are reduced by lease incentives. We generally do not include options to extend or terminate a lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by identifying components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. We have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, respectively, as of January 28, 2023.\nOur detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples and other observable metrics. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nOur valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate.\nWe amortize our definite-lived intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable and monitor for the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We record an impairment loss for any portion of the carrying value that is not recoverable.\n46\nDerivatives\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and losses, if any, related to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe utilized “receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate” interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”). Our interest rate swap contracts are considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional amounts match those of our fixed-rate debt being hedged and are, therefore, accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method. Under the shortcut method, we recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on these contracts directly to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; • Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; • • Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\nFair value remeasurements are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected to generate. The key inputs to the DCF model generally include our forecasts of net cash generated from investment operations, as well as an appropriate discount rate.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these assets, we do not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is recorded within SG&A and Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non-restructuring and restructuring charges, respectively.\n47\nInsurance\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to workers’ compensation, medical, general liability and auto claims; however, we obtain third-party excess insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims. Some of these self-insured losses are managed through a wholly-owned insurance captive. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We utilize valuations provided by qualified, independent third-party actuaries as well as internal insurance and risk expertise. Our self-insured liabilities included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows ($ in millions):\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nAccrued liabilities Long-term liabilities Total\n$\n$\n111 53 164\n$\n$\n80 51 131\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nIn determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events, such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws, are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Income tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe major components of accrued liabilities are sales tax liabilities, advertising accruals, sales return reserves, insurance liabilities and customer deposits.\nLong-Term Liabilities\nThe major components of long-term liabilities are unrecognized tax benefits, deferred revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and income tax liabilities.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the periods. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in SG&A, have not been significant in any period presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of products and services, both as a principal and as an agent. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and is reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and contract cancellations based on historical refund rates, with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. We defer the revenue associated with any unsatisfied performance obligation until the obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical control, either in our stores or at their home. Any fees charged to customers for delivery are a component of the transaction price and are recognized when delivery has been completed. We use delivery information to determine when to recognize revenue for delivered products and any related delivery fee revenue.\n48\nIn most cases, we are the principal to product contracts as we have control of the physical products prior to transfer to the customer. Accordingly, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily activation-based software licenses and third-party stored-value cards, we are the sales agent providing access to the content and recognize commission revenue net of amounts due to third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control passes upon providing access of the content to the customer.\nWarranty obligations associated with the sale of our exclusive brands products are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the product’s intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract.\nServices - When we are the principal\nWe recognize revenue for services, such as delivery, installation, set-up, software troubleshooting, product repair, and data services once the service is completed, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the service or serviced product. Payment terms are typically at the point of sale, but may also occur upon completion of the service. Our service contracts are primarily with retail customers and merchandise vendors (for factory warranty repairs).\nFor technical support membership contracts (for example, our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering), we are responsible for fulfilling the support services to customers. These contracts have terms ranging from one month to one year and typically contain several performance obligations. Payment for the membership contracts is due at the start of the contract period. We have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component. For performance obligations provided over time, we recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method is derived by analysis of historical utilization patterns as this depicts when customers use the services and, accordingly, when delivery of the performance obligation occurs. There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and (3) assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When insufficient history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.\nServices - When we are the agent\nOn behalf of third-party underwriters, we sell various hardware protection plans to customers that provide extended warranty coverage on their device purchases. Such plans have terms ranging from one month to five years. Payment is due at the point of sale. Third-party underwriters assume the risk associated with the coverage and are primarily responsible for fulfillment. We record the net commissions (the amount charged to the customer less the premiums remitted to the underwriter) as revenue at a point in time when the corresponding product revenue is recognized. In addition, in some cases we are eligible to receive profit- sharing payments, a form of variable consideration, which are dependent upon the financial performance of the underwriter’s protection plan portfolio. We do not share in any losses of the portfolio. We record any profit share as revenue once the uncertainty associated with the portfolio period, which is calendar-year based, is no longer constrained using the expected value method. This typically occurs during our fiscal fourth quarter, with payment of the profit share occurring in the subsequent fiscal year. Service and commission revenues earned from the sale of extended warranties represented 0.9%, 1.4% and 1.6% of revenue in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nWe earn commissions from mobile network carriers to sell service contracts on their platforms. Revenue is recognized when control passes at a point in time upon sale of the contract and activation of the customer on the provider’s platform. The time between when we activate the service with the customer and when we receive payment from the content provider is generally within 30 to 60 days, which is after control has passed. Activation commissions are subject to repayment to the carrier primarily in the event of customer cancellation for specified time periods after the sale. Commission revenue from mobile network carriers is reported net of the expected cancellations, which we estimate based on historical cancellation rates.\nCredit Card Revenue\nWe offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Approximately 25% of revenue in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was transacted using one of our branded cards. We provide a license to our brand and marketing services, and we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks are the sole owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables related to these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions with customers. We are eligible to receive a profit share from certain of our banking partners based on the annual performance of their corresponding portfolio, and we receive quarterly payments based on forecasts of full-year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record such profit share as revenue over time using the most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit-share payments occur quarterly, shortly after the end of each program quarter.\n49\nBest Buy Gift Cards\nWe sell Best Buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do not expire. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed (“breakage”). We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns. Typically, over 90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90% of gift card breakage revenue) occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage income was $59 million, $49 million and $33 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nSales Incentives\nWe frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a gift card at the time of purchase or an instant savings coupon that can be redeemed towards a future purchase. For sales incentives issued to customers that are only earned in conjunction with the purchase of products or services, the sales incentives represent an option that is a material right and, accordingly, is a performance obligation in the contract. The revenue allocated to these sales incentives is deferred as a contract liability and is based on the cards that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation when it is redeemed by the customer or when it is not expected to be redeemed. There is judgment in determining (1) the level at which we group incentives based on similar redemption patterns, (2) future redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate number of incentives that we do not expect to be redeemed.\nWe also issue coupons that are not earned in conjunction with a purchase of a product or service, typically as part of targeted marketing activities. This is not a performance obligation, but is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price when redeemed by the customer.\nCustomer Loyalty Programs\nWe have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our private label and co-branded credit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Certificate expirations are typically two months from the date of issuance. Our loyalty programs represent customer options that provide a material right and, accordingly, are performance obligations for each applicable contract. The relative standalone selling price of points earned by our loyalty program members is deferred and included in Deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation over time when a certificate is redeemed by the customer. There is inherent judgment in estimating the value of our customer loyalty programs as they are susceptible to factors outside of our influence, particularly customer redemption activity. However, we have significant experience in estimating the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates, based primarily on historical data.\nCost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following tables illustrate the primary costs classified in each major expense category.\nCost of Sales\nCost of products sold, including:\nFreight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers Vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs Cash discounts on payments to merchandise vendors Physical inventory losses Markdowns Customer shipping and handling expenses Costs associated with operating our distribution network, including payroll and benefit costs, occupancy costs and depreciation Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our distribution centers to our retail stores\nCost of services provided, including:\nPayroll and benefit costs for services employees associated with providing the service Cost of replacement parts and related freight expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nPayroll and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees Occupancy and maintenance costs of retail, services and corporate facilities Depreciation and amortization related to retail, services and corporate assets Advertising costs Vendor allowances that are a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs Tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees Charitable contributions Outside and outsourced service fees Long-lived asset impairment charges Other administrative costs, such as supplies, travel and lodging\n50\nVendor Allowances\nWe receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor’s products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within SG&A when incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of digital advertisements. Advertising expenses were $864 million, $915 million and $819 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards, which is determined based on the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant for time-based and performance-based share awards, and Monte-Carlo simulation for market-based share awards. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are required, except for performance-based share awards that vest on a graded basis, in which case the expense is front-loaded or recognized on a graded-attribution basis. Forfeitures are expensed as incurred or upon termination.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity.\n2. Acquisitions\nCurrent Health Ltd.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”), a care-at-home technology platform, on November 2, 2021, for net cash consideration of $389 million. The acquired assets included $351 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and was deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition is aligned with our focus in virtual care to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers and is included in our Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and was not material to the results of operations.\nTwo Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”), a direct-to-consumer outdoor furniture company, on November 4, 2021, for net cash consideration of $79 million. The acquired assets included $47 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit and was deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition expands our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and was not material to the results of our operations.\n3.

Charges incurred relate to employee termination benefits within our Domestic and International segments of $140 million and $5 million, respectively. We currently do not expect the remaining charges in fiscal 2024 related to this initiative to be material to the results of our operations.\nAll charges incurred related to this initiative were from continuing operations and were presented within Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n51\n2021\n277 - 277\nRestructuring accrual activity related to the fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative described above was as follows ($ in millions):\nDomestic\nTermination Benefits International\nBalances as of January 29, 2022\nCharges Cash payments Adjustments(1)\nBalances as of January 28, 2023\n$\n$\n145 (38) (5) 102\n$\n$\n5 - - 5\n$\n$\n(1) Represents adjustments to previously planned organizational changes and higher-than-expected employee retention.\nMexico Exit and Strategic Realignment\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico and began taking other actions to more broadly align our organizational structure in support of our strategy. Charges incurred in our International segment primarily related to our decision to exit our operations in Mexico. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets accounted for at fair value were as follows ($ in millions):\nAssets Money market funds(2) Time deposits(3) Money market funds(2) Marketable securities that fund deferred compensation(4) Interest rate swap derivative instruments(5)\nBalance Sheet Location(1) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents Other current assets Other assets Other assets\nFair Value Hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 1 Level 1 Level 2\n$\nFair Value at\nJanuary 28, 2023 280 203 178 47 -\n$\nJanuary 29, 2022 548 278 - 54 50\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)\nBalance sheet location is determined by the length to maturity at date of purchase. Valued at quoted market prices in active markets at period end. Valued at face value plus accrued interest at period end, which approximates fair value. Valued using the performance of mutual funds that trade with sufficient frequency and volume to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis. Valued using readily observable market inputs. These instruments are custom, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties that are not traded on an active market. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments, for additional information.\n53\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we recorded asset impairments related to our exit from operations in Mexico. See Note 3, Restructuring, for additional information regarding the charges incurred and the net carrying value of assets remaining.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of cash, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable and other payables approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we estimate that the carrying values for these investments approximate their fair values.\nLong-term debt is presented at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If our long-term debt were recorded at fair value, it would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt balances were as follows ($ in millions):\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nLong-term debt(1) (1)\nExcludes debt discounts, issuance costs and finance lease obligations.\n$\n1,019\n$\n1,143\n$\n1,205\n$\n1,200\n6. Derivative Instruments\nWe manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain risks by using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations and by using interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 2028 Notes. In addition, we use foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies.\nOur derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for gross fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments and corresponding fair value classifications.\nNotional amounts of our derivative instruments were as follows ($ in millions):\nNotional Amount\nContract Type\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nDerivatives designated as net investment hedges Derivatives designated as interest rate swap contracts No hedging designation (foreign exchange forward contracts)\nTotal\n$\n$\n114 500 56 670\n$\n$\n155 500 68 723\nEffects of our derivative instruments on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows ($ in millions):\nContract Type\nStatement of Earnings Location\n2023\nGain (Loss) Recognized 2022\n2021\nInterest rate swap contracts Adjustments to carrying value of long-term debt\nTotal\nInterest expense Interest expense\n$\n$\n(57) 57 -\n$\n$\n(41) 41 -\n$\n$\n2 (2) -\n7.

Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nU.S. Revolving Credit Facility\nOn May 18, 2021, we entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five Year Facility Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Five Year Facility Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in May 2026. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five Year Facility Agreement as of January 28, 2023, or January 29, 2022.\nThe interest rate under the Five Year Facility Agreement is variable and is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s prime rate, (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate plus, in each case, 0.5%, and (3) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), subject to certain adjustments plus 1%, and (b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the “LIBOR Margin”). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon our current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the Five Year Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.00% to 0.225%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.805% to 1.225%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.07% to 0.15%. Additionally, the Five Year Facility Agreement includes fallback language related to the transition from LIBOR to alternative rates. The Five Year Facility Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries’ abilities to incur liens on certain assets; make material changes in corporate structure or the nature of our business; dispose of material assets; engage in certain mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes; or engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\n55\nThe Five Year Facility Agreement also contains covenants that require us to maintain a maximum cash flow leverage ratio. The Five Year Facility Agreement contains default provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants.\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following ($ in millions):\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\n2028 Notes 2030 Notes Interest rate swap valuation adjustments\nSubtotal\nDebt discounts and issuance costs Finance lease obligations Total long-term debt Less: current portion\nTotal long-term debt, less current portion\n$\n$\n500 650 (7) 1,143 (9) 42\n1,176 16 1,160\n$\n$\n500 650 50 1,200 (11) 40\n1,229 13 1,216\n2028 Notes\nIn September 2018, we issued $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”).

Net proceeds from the issuance were $495 million after underwriting and issuance discounts totaling $5 million.\nWe may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2028 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.\nThe 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2028 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.\n2030 Notes\nIn October 2020, we issued $650 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030, (the “2030 Notes”) that bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.95% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2021.

Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2030 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.\nThe 2030 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2030 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nFair Value and Future Maturities\nSee Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair value of long-term debt.\nAs of January 28, 2023, we do not have any future maturities of long-term debt within the next five fiscal years.\n9. Shareholders’ Equity\nStock Compensation Plans\nThe Best Buy Co., Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) approved by shareholders in June 2020 authorizes us to issue up to 18.6 million shares plus the remaining unused shares available for issuance under the Best Buy Co., Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). In addition, shares subject to any outstanding awards under our prior stock incentive plans that are forfeited, cancelled or reacquired by the Company are available for reissuance under the 2020 Plan. The 2014 Plan was terminated as to the grant of any additional awards, but prior awards remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of such plan.\n56\nThe 2020 Plan authorizes us to grant or issue non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity awards.

Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and non-vested share awards. Non-vested market-based share awards and non-vested performance-based share awards are included in the average diluted shares outstanding each period if established market or performance criteria have been met at the end of the respective periods.\n58\nAs of January 28, 2023, options to purchase common stock were all in-the-money and outstanding as follows (shares in millions):\nExercisable\nUnexercisable\nTotal\nIn-the-money\nShares 0.4\n% 51% $\nWeighted- Average Price per Share\n54.94\nShares 0.3\n% 49% $\nWeighted- Average Price per Share\n67.13\nShares 0.7\n% 100% $\nWeighted- Average Price per Share\n60.91\nReconciliations of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nNumerator Net earnings Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding Dilutive effect of stock compensation plan awards Weighted-average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution\n$\n1,419\n224.8 0.9 225.7\n$\n2,454\n246.8 2.5 249.3\n$\n1,798\n259.6 3.4 263.0\nPotential shares which were anti-dilutive and excluded from weighted-average share computations\n0.7\n0.1\n\nBasic earnings per share Diluted earnings per share\n$ $\n6.31 6.29\n$ $\n9.94 9.84\n$ $\n6.93 6.84\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nOn February 28, 2022, our Board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on February 16, 2021.

The increase in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to current year loss activity from international and state net operating loss carryforwards, the set-up of additional valuation allowances against U.S. federal foreign tax credit and state capital loss carryforwards, and the exchange rate impact on the valuation allowance against certain international net operating loss carryforwards. These increases were partially offset by the expiration of certain international net operating loss carryforwards and the release of valuation allowances relating to federal net operating and capital loss carryforwards.\nReconciliations of changes in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows ($ in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nBalances at beginning of period\nGross increases related to prior period tax positions Gross decreases related to prior period tax positions(1) Gross increases related to current period tax positions Settlements with taxing authorities Lapse of statute of limitations\nBalances at end of period\n$\n$\n235 28 (75) 21 - (46) 163\n$\n$\n327 3 (103) 28 (7) (13) 235\n$\n$\n318 17 (25) 29 (1) (11) 327\n(1) Represents multi-jurisdiction, multi-year resolutions of certain discrete tax matters.\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $141 million, $214 million and $307 million as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively, would favorably impact our effective income tax rate if recognized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties (not included in the “unrecognized tax benefits” above), as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements, as components of income tax expense. Interest income of $6 million, interest income of $20 million and interest expense of $4 million was recognized in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. As of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, we had accrued interest of $42 million, $46 million and $74 million, respectively.\n61\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before fiscal 2011.\nChanges in state, federal and foreign tax laws may increase or decrease our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations and controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various taxing authorities or reach resolutions of income tax examinations or controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments, resolutions or law changes could result in changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. The actual amount of any changes could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any assessments, resolutions or law changes. An estimate of the amount or range of such changes cannot be made at this time.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n12. Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Participants may choose from various investment options, including a fund comprised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100% of the first 3% of participating employees’ contributions and 50% of the next 2%. Employer contributions vest immediately. Total employer contributions were $77 million, $77 million and $44 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nWe offer a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for highly-compensated employees and members of our Board. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are invested in options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. The liability for compensation deferred under the plan was $20 million and $24 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively, and is included in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair value of assets held for deferred compensation.\n13. Contingencies and Commitments\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Where appropriate, we have made accruals with respect to these matters, which are reflected on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made. We provide disclosure of matters where we believe it is reasonably possible the impact may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe had outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate fair value of $72 million as of January 28, 2023.\n14.

            "The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.",

The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes.",
            "Our backlog at December 31, 2022 was $404,381. We expect approximately 17% to be converted to revenue through 2023 and approximately 71% through 2026, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue due to timing of 787 deliveries from inventory, timing of 737 MAX delivery resumption in China, timing of entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n112\n2020",
            "We increased the production rate to 31 per month in 2022, and expect to implement further gradual production rate increases based on market demand and supply chain capacity. We expensed abnormal production costs of $188 million and $1,887 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.",
            "777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 40 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 3 per month for the 777/777X programs. The accounting quantity for the 777X program increased by 50 units during 2022 reflecting the launch of the 777X-8 freighter during the first quarter of 2022. First delivery of the 777X-8 freighter is expected in 2027.",

            "During the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 787 program plus costs already included in 787 inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,460 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: deferred production costs of $12,689 and $11,693, $1,831 and $1,907 of supplier advances, and $1,722 and $1,815 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At December 31, 2022, $9,881 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders, and $4,530 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. We are currently producing at abnormally low rates resulting in abnormal production costs that are being expensed as incurred. We expensed abnormal production costs of $1,240 and $468 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.",

The changes in assets and liabilities reflect the significant increase in commercial aircraft inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.5 billion in 2021 and $2.2 billion in 2020.

She has supervised the finance and accounting professionals responsible for, and personally analyzed and evaluated, financial statements, as well as internal controls over financial reporting. She is also familiar with audit committee functions through her service on the Company’s Audit Committee.

Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the income statement and the balance sheet.",
        "expected": "-3.7",
        "predicted": "To calculate the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), we need to find the values for DIO, DSO, and DPO. \n\n1. Calculate DIO:\n   - FY2018 Inventory: Not directly available, but we can infer it from the Balance Sheet (Passage 6). We know that the FY2019 Inventory is 2,492.1 million. We also know the FY2019 COGS is 2,515.9 million. Since the COGS is the cost of the sold items, and Inventory is the unsold items, we can use the COGS and Inventory values for FY2019 to estimate the FY2018 Inventory. Assuming the COGS and Inventory are roughly proportional, we can use the ratio of FY2019 COGS to FY2019 Inventory to estimate FY2018 Inventory.\n   - FY2019 Inventory / FY2019 COGS = 2,492.1 / 2,515.9 ≈ 0.990\n   - FY2018 Inventory ≈ FY2019 Inventory / 0.990 ≈ 2,493.5 million\n   - DIO = 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS)\n   - Average inventory = (2,493.5 + 2,492.1) / 2 ≈ 2,492.8\n   - DIO = 365 * 2,492.8 / 2,515.9 ≈ 362.31\n\n2. Calculate DSO:\n   - FY2018 Accounts receivable is not directly available, but we can infer it from the Balance Sheet (Passage 6). We know that the FY2019 Accounts receivable is 1,701.1 million. We also know the FY2019 Revenue is 16,865.2 million. Since the Revenue is the sales, and Accounts receivable is the unpaid sales, we can use the Revenue and Accounts receivable values for FY2019 to estimate the FY2018 Accounts receivable. Assuming the Revenue and Accounts receivable are roughly proportional, we can use the ratio of FY2019 Revenue to FY2019 Accounts receivable to estimate FY2018 Accounts receivable.\n   - FY2019 Revenue / FY2019 Accounts receivable = 16,865.2 / 1,701.1 ≈ 9.92\n   - FY2018 Accounts receivable ≈ FY2019 Accounts receivable / 9.92 ≈ 1,713.5 million\n   - DSO = 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue)\n   - Average accounts receivable = (1,713.5 + 1,701.1) / 2 ≈ 1,707.3\n   - DSO = 365 * 1,707.3 / 16,865.2 ≈ 40.12\n\n3. Calculate DPO:\n   - FY2018 Accounts payable is not directly available, but we can infer it from the Balance Sheet (Passage 6). We know that the FY2019 Accounts payable is 655.2 million. We also know the FY2019 COGS is 2,515.9 million and the change in Inventory is 2,492.1 - 2,493.5 ≈ -1.4 million. Since the COGS is the cost of the sold items, and Inventory is the unsold items, we can use the COGS and Inventory values for FY2019 to estimate the FY2018 Accounts payable. Assuming the COGS and Inventory are roughly proportional, we can use the ratio of FY2019 COGS to FY2019 Inventory to estimate FY2018 Accounts payable.\n   - FY2019 Inventory / FY2019 COGS = 2,492.1 / 2,515.9 ≈ 0.990\n   - FY2018 Accounts payable ≈ FY2019 Accounts payable / 0.990 ≈ 662.2 million\n   - DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019)\n   - Average accounts payable = (662.2 + 655.2) / 2 ≈ 658.7\n   - DPO = 365 * 658.7 / (2,515.9 + (-1.4)) ≈ 235.19\n\n4. Calculate CCC:\n   - CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO\n   - CCC = 362.31 + 40.12 - 235.19 ≈ 167.24\n\nSo, the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) for General Mills is approximately 167.24 days.",

But we can find the operating income from Passage 1, and then calculate the COGS by reversing the operating income calculation.\n\nThe operating income is:\nOperating income = Net income + Interest expense + Other expense/(income) + Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes - Depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses) - Integration and restructuring expenses - Deal costs - Unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges - Impairment losses\n\nFrom Passage 1, we have the following values:\nNet income = $1,856 million (for FY2019)\nInterest expense = 6.1 pp (in millions) = $6.1 million\nOther expense/(income) = -0.9 pp (in millions) = -$0.9 million\nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes = -0.0 pp (in millions) = $0 million\nDepreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses) = 3.2 pp (in millions) = $3.2 million\nIntegration and restructuring expenses = 1.9 pp (in millions) = $1.9 million\nDeal costs = 0.8 pp (in millions) = $0.8 million\nUnrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges = -0.3 pp (in millions) = -$0.3 million\nImpairment losses = 0.2 pp (in millions) = $0.2 million\n\nThe operating income is:\nOperating income = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 + $0 - $3.2 - $1.9 - $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2 = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 - $3.2 - $1.9 - $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2 = $1,857.6 million\n\nThe COGS is:\nCOGS = Net income + Interest expense + Other expense/(income) + Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes + Integration and restructuring expenses + Deal costs + Unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges + Impairment losses - Operating income\nCOGS = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 + $0 + $1.9 + $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2 - $1,857.6 = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 + $1.9 + $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2 - $1,857.6 = $6.9 million\n\nHowever, this is not correct. We should calculate COGS as follows:\nCOGS = Net income + Interest expense + Other expense/(income) + Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes + Depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses) + Integration and restructuring expenses + Deal costs + Unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges + Impairment losses - Operating income\nCOGS = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 + $0 + $3.2 + $1.9 + $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2 - $1,857.6 = $11.7 million\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio is:\nInventory turnover ratio = COGS / Average inventory\nInventory turnover ratio = $11.7 million / $1,618 million\nInventory turnover ratio = 0.0072 or 0.72 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nHowever, the COGS seems too low.

Integration and restructuring expenses - Deal costs - Unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges - Impairment losses\n$1,857.6 = $1,856 + $6.1 - $0.9 + $0 - $3.2 - $1.9 - $0.8 + $0.3 + $0.2\n\nLet's try to calculate the COGS from the balance sheet:\nCOGS = Cost of Goods Sold\nCOGS = Beginning inventory + Purchases - Ending inventory\nHowever, we cannot find the purchases directly from the given information.\n\nLet's try to calculate the COGS from the operating activities in the cash flow statement:\nCash flows from operating activities = Net income + Depreciation + Change in working capital -

If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels."

The line \"Capital expenditures\" for FY2018 is not provided, however, we can find it in the passage that mentions the total capital expenditures in 2019. We can find the capex for 2018 in the cash flow statement in passage 1 which is not explicitly stated but can be calculated from the statement of cash flows in passage 1.  The difference in cash used in investing activities between 2019 and 2018 is $739 million - $635 million = $104 million. This is the capital expenditures for 2018.\n- FY2019: $739 million (Passage 4)\n- FY2020: Not provided in the passages, but we can find the capex in the cash flow statement (Passage 1). The line \"Capital expenditures\" for FY2020 is not provided, however, we can find it in the passage that mentions the total cash used in investing activities between 2019 and 2020. We can find the capex for 2020 in the statement of cash flows in passage 1 which is not explicitly stated but can be calculated from the statement of cash flows in passage 1.  The difference in cash used in investing activities between 2020 and 2019 is $168,447 - $112,622 = $55,825 thousand. This is the capital expenditures for 2020.\n\nNow, let's convert the capex values to thousands: \n- FY2018: $104 million = $104,000 thousand\n- FY2019: $739 million = $739,000 thousand\n- FY2020: $55,825 thousand\n\nNow, let's find the total revenue for each year:\n- FY2018: $5,162,082 thousand (Passage 6)\n- FY2019: $12,899,672 thousand (Passage 6)\n- FY2020: $5,162,082 thousand (Passage 6)\n\nNow, let's calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year:\n- FY2018: ($104,000 / $5,162,082) * 100 = 2.0%\n- FY2019: ($739,000 / $12,899,672) * 100 = 5.7%\n- FY2020: ($55,825 / $5,162,082) * 100 = 1.1%\n\nNow, let's calculate the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue:\n(2.0 + 5.7 + 1.1) / 3 = 2.9%\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts is 2.9%.",

BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nOur vision\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world.\nThe mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology. Mobility is not focused on any one device; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide people and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party datacenters. Mobility encompasses the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany our customers as they move from setting to setting in their lives. We are transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this digital transformation, and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.\nWhat we offer\nFounded in 1975, we operate worldwide in over 190 countries. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives.\nOur products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories, that integrate with our cloud-based offerings. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.\nThe ambitions that drive us\nTo carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\nReinvent productivity and business processes.\n3\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\n\nBuild the intelligent cloud platform.\n\nCreate more personal computing.\nReinvent productivity and business processes\nWe believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services that span devices and platforms. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We invent new scenarios that in turn create opportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their transformation while respecting each person’s privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, communication, and business process tools including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Skype, and Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”). With Office 365, we provide these familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud services, enabling access from anywhere and any device. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers. We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are mobile, collaborative, intelligent and trustworthy. We offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We engineer our applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.\nBuild the intelligent cloud platform\nIn deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives, increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength. Microsoft is one of two leaders in the market.\nThe shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. As one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we are well-positioned to help businesses move to the cloud and focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers like Microsoft.\nWe believe our server products and cloud services, which include Microsoft SQL Server (“SQL Server”), Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), make us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We are working to enhance the return on IT investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner’s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they want.\nWe enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications, both our own and third-party, and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. We continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our platform is extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nCreate more personal computing\nWe strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. A computing device should be not just a tool, but a partner. Windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in this era of more personal computing. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices. We developed Windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users, but more safe, secure, and always up-to-date. Windows 10 is more personal and productive with functionality such as Cortana, Windows Hello, Windows Ink, Microsoft Edge, and universal applications. Windows 10 is designed to foster innovation – from us, our partners, and developers – through rich and consistent experiences across the range of existing devices and entirely new device categories.\nOur ambition for Windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key levers: an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10; our own commitment to the health and profitability of our first-party premium device portfolio; and monetization opportunities such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search advertising. Our OEM partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations for Windows 10. We now have the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.\nWith the unified Windows operating system, developers and OEMs can contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest heavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer opportunity by unifying the installed base to Windows 10 through upgrades and ongoing updates, and by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets. As part of our strategic objectives, we are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We are developing new input/output methods within Windows 10, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms to power more personal computing experiences.\nOur future opportunity\nThere are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\nDelivering new productivity and business processes to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact\nwith one another.\n\nBuilding and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.\n\nEstablishing the Windows platform across servers and devices, both our own and third-party, and the cloud to drive a thriving\necosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.\n\nDeveloping new devices that have increasingly natural ways to interact with them, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented\nreality holograms.\n\nApplying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf to understand and interpret our needs using\nnatural methods of communication.\nWe believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.\nIn June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\nOur reportable segments are described below.\nProductivity and Business Processes\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nOffice Commercial, including volume licensing and subscriptions to Office 365 commercial for products and services such as Office,\nExchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”).\n\nOffice Consumer, including Office sold through retail or through an Office 365 consumer subscription, and Office Consumer Services,\nincluding Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.\n\nDynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics CRM Online.\nOffice Commercial\nOffice Commercial is designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets such as security, analytics, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance and the number of information workers in an enterprise, as well as the continued shift to Office 365. Office 365 is our cloud-based service that provides access to Office plus other productivity services. CALs provide access rights to certain Office Commercial products and services, including Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and revenue is reported along with the associated Office products and services.\nOffice Consumer\nOffice Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the combination of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift to Office 365. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nDynamics\nDynamics provides business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.\nCompetition\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note-taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy-to-use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud.\nOur Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and mid-sized businesses, our Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite. Salesforce.com’s cloud CRM offerings compete directly with our Dynamics CRM on-premises and CRM Online offerings.\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nServer products and cloud services, including SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, as well\nas Azure.\n\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\nServer Products and Cloud Services\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server products and cloud services revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.\nAzure is a scalable cloud platform with computing, networking, storage, database, and management, along with advanced services such as analytics, and comprehensive solutions such as Enterprise Mobility Suite. Azure includes a flexible platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise, mobile, web, and Internet of Things applications, for any platform or device without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software.\n7\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nEnterprise Services\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\nCompetition\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.\nWe compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e- business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise- wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others.\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities.\nOur Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.\nMore Personal Computing\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nWindows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system, volume licensing of the Windows operating system, patent licensing, Windows Embedded, MSN display advertising, and Windows Phone licensing.\n\nDevices, including Microsoft Surface (“Surface”), phones, and PC accessories.\n8\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\n\nGaming, including Xbox hardware; Xbox Live, comprising transactions, subscriptions, and advertising; video games; and third-party\nvideo game royalties.\n\nSearch advertising.\nWindows\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. We consider the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices.\nWindows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by:\n\nThe mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n\nDifferences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets.\n\nAttachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n\nCustomer mix between consumer, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises.\n\nChanges in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n\nPricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional\nsystem builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n\nPiracy.\nVolume licensing of the Windows operating system is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings.\nWindows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services.\nDisplay advertising primarily includes MSN ads. In June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales responsibility.\nThe Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. Prior to our acquisition of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”) in April 2014, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance.\nDevices\nWe design, manufacture, and sell devices such as Surface, phones, and other intelligent devices, as well as PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using integrated Microsoft services and Windows. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive. Our latest Surface devices, the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, were released in October 2015. We began manufacturing and selling Microsoft Lumia (“Lumia”) phones and other phones with the acquisition of NDS in April 2014. In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. We also recently announced the sale of our entry- level feature phone business in May 2016. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\n9\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nGaming\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment through the use of our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November 2013, respectively, and recently announced Xbox One S will be released in August 2016. We also launched our Windows 10 Xbox app in July 2015. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live services consist of subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising, and are designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. We also design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. We acquired Mojang Synergies AB, the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, in November 2014. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. We believe the success of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals.\nSearch Advertising\nSearch advertising, including Bing and Bing Ads, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo!, in which we provide and monetize search results. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.\nCompetition\nThe Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\nOur devices face competition from various computer, tablet, hardware, and phone manufacturers, and offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers. These manufacturers include Apple, as well as our Windows OEM partners.\nOur gaming platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.\nIn addition to Sony and Nintendo, we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live faces competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google.\nOur search advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nOPERATIONS\nWe have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia.\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam. We announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business in May 2016, which includes the sale of our phone manufacturing facility in Vietnam.\nOur devices, other than phones, are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nDuring fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, research and development expense was $12.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.4 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 14%, 13%, and 13% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts.\nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups.\n\nApplications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity,\ncommunication, education, search, and other information categories.\n\nCloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, enterprise resource planning,\nmanagement, development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n\nWindows and Devices Engineering Group, focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our\ndevices, and associated online marketplaces.\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 61,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000\n11\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\npending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or Microsoft’s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community.\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\nInvesting in the Future\nMicrosoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware.\nWhile our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company.\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of- the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation.\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, distributors and resellers, online, and Microsoft retail stores. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products.\nOEMs\nWe distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition to these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365 subscription.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are referred to as “Direct OEMs,” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUST, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called “system builders”), which source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\nDistributors and Resellers\nMany organizations that license our products and services through Enterprise Agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors”, or “ESAs”). Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSPs”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small- and medium-sized organizations. ESAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing programs discussed under “Licensing Options” below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International.\nOur Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets, including Microsoft retail stores. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support.\nOnline\nAlthough on-premises software continues to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide commercial cloud-based solutions such as Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online. We also provide online content services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Skype, and Windows Store. Other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers, as well as Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. As we increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud- based services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized businesses. These programs include direct sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resale of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers.\nWe also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces.\nLICENSING OPTIONS\nWe license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\n13\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nCustomer Licensing Programs\nEnterprise Agreement Licensing\nDesigned primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations that want to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization. Under the Enterprise Agreement, customers can acquire licenses for online services and/or software products with Software Assurance, which convey rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses or, under the Enterprise Subscription option, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription licenses for a specified period (generally three years). Online services are also available, and subscriptions are generally structured with three-year terms.\nMicrosoft Product and Services Agreement Licensing\nSuited for medium- and large-sized organizations, the Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (“MPSA”) provides customers the ability to purchase online services subscriptions, software licenses, software licenses with Software Assurance, and renewals of Software Assurance through a single agreement. Software Assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available for a term of up to three years. We plan on expanding the offers under the MPSA in fiscal year 2017 to better enable organizations to obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across their organization.\nSelect Plus Licensing\nDesigned primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations, the Select Plus program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer’s election, Software Assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less). Similar to Open programs, the Select Plus program allows customers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. A subset of online services is also available for purchase through the Select Plus program, and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years.\nIn July 2014, we announced the retirement over a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial customers, in favor of modern licensing options. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations, and customers who want to purchase licenses were encouraged to transition to the MPSA. Starting in July 2016, we will no longer be accepting orders from commercial organizations for Select Plus after their next agreement anniversary. We expect the entire Select Plus business to transition to the MPSA within a few years.\nOpen Licensing\nDesigned primarily for small- and medium-sized organizations, the Open programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at the customer’s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (generally two or three years depending on the specific programs used). The Open programs have several variations to fit customers’ diverse ways of purchasing. Under the Open License program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with Software Assurance, and/or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of other existing volume licensing agreements. Under the Open Value and Open Value Subscription programs, customers can acquire perpetual or subscription licenses, respectively, over a three-year period. Online services are available in each of the Open programs.\nCustomer Licensing Programs — Online Services Only\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to easily purchase Microsoft Online Services. The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.\n14\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1\nPartner Programs\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program enables partners to directly manage their entire Microsoft cloud customer lifecycle. Partners in this program use dedicated tools to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. Partners can easily package their own tools, products, and services, and combine them into one monthly or annual customer bill.\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term, and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption.\nThe Microsoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program that enables partners to package Microsoft online services with the partners’ services.\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software programs.\nCUSTOMERS\nOur customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations, large global enterprises, public sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015, or 2014. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\nOur executive officers as of July 28, 2016 were as follows:\nName\nAge\nPosition with the Company\nSatya Nadella Christopher C.

Of the total employed people, 38,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 37,000 in product research and development; 29,000 in sales and marketing; and 10,000 in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nIn June 2015, management approved a restructuring plan that eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016, primarily in our phone hardware business.\nWe periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com. At our Investor Relations website, www.microsoft.com/investor, we make available free of charge a variety of information for investors. Our goal is to maintain the Investor Relations website as a portal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us, including:\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\n\nInformation on our business strategies, financial results, and metrics for investors.\n\nAnnouncements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and\ncompetitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available.\n\nPress releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news.\n16\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1, 1A\n\nCorporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of\nconduct and ethics, global corporate social responsibility initiatives, and other governance-related policies.\n\nOther news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting.\n\nOpportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time.\nThe information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.\nCompetition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\nCompetition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.\n\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to\n17\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\nattract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n\nCompeting platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as “stores”) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.\nBusiness model competition\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\nEven as we transition to a mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n\nSome companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at nominal cost to end-users, and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality of our products.\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\nOur increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud- based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. The Company’s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including\nPCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices.\n\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n18\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\n\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.\n\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of\nour competitors.\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.\nWe make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.\nThe launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In June 2016, we announced our acquisition of LinkedIn for approximately $26.2 billion. The LinkedIn acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\n19\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. Our acquisition of LinkedIn will result in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances.\nWe may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights\nProtecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.\nWe may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses\nWe expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements.\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\n20\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.\nSecurity of Microsoft’s information technology\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer- oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data\nSecurity threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ purchasing decisions.\nTo defend against security threats, both to our internal IT systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.\nThe cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional\n21\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\nproducts or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.\nDisclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.\nWe may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (“EU”), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nThe European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our\n22\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\ncompetitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.\nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:\n\nWe may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.\n\nWe may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do\nnot protect our associated intellectual property.\n\nThe rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions.\n\nOur ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.\nOur global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the US in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in various countries. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.\nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from\n23\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us. The growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in October 2015 the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the EU/U.S. safe harbor framework, in place since 2000, that enabled companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. Although other legally-recognized methods to enable data transfers currently remain valid, the reasoning of the ECJ striking down the safe harbor framework could be used to challenge those methods in future complaints. There is a recognized need for a new regulatory safe harbor framework that will also support other methods of data transfer between the EU and U.S. Outcomes may include a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, a new EU data protection directive, or a range of legal requirements adopted by individual EU member states, or no action at all. One or more of these outcomes may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.\n24\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A\nOur hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.\nOur software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.\nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.\n25\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 1A, 1B, 2\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2016 that remain unresolved.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 500 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease. In addition, we own and lease space domestically that includes office, retail, and datacenter space.\nWe also own and lease facilities internationally. Properties that we own include: our research and development centers in China and India; our operations in Ireland and Singapore; our phone manufacturing facilities, predominantly in Vietnam; and our facilities in the United Kingdom. The largest leased office spaces include the following locations: Finland, China, India, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. In addition to the above locations, we have various product development facilities, both domestically and internationally, as described in the “Research and Development” section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nThe table below shows a summary of facilities owned and leased domestically and internationally as of June 30, 2016:\n(Square feet in millions)\nLocation\nU.S. International\nOwned\n16.4 9.0\nLeased 9.7 10.8\nTotal\n25.4\n20.5\n26\nTotal\n26.1 19.8\n45.9\nTable of Contents\nPART I Item 3, 4\nITEM 3.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives.\nWe generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\nMuch of our focus in fiscal year 2016 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central ambitions that support our strategy: reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2016 included:\n\nCommercial cloud annualized revenue run rate* exceeded $12.1 billion.\n\nOffice 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 23.1 million.\n29\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online seat additions more than doubled year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Azure (“Azure”) revenue grew 113%, with usage of Azure compute and Azure SQL database more than doubling year-over-\nyear. Enterprise Mobility customers nearly doubled year-over-year to over 33,000.\n\nWindows 10 is now active on more than 350 million devices around the world.\n\nXbox Live monthly active users grew 33% year-over-year to 49 million.\n\nCommercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics Online, and other cloud properties.\nIn June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash (the “Merger Agreement”). We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIn’s shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.\nIn May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.\nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, and continuing into fiscal year 2016, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.\nSee a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).\nSeasonality\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.\nUnearned Revenue\nQuarterly and annual revenue is impacted by the deferral of revenue, primarily including:\n\nRevenue deferred on Windows 10 licenses to reflect ratable recognition over the life of the device.\n\nRevenue deferred on bundled products and services (“Bundled Offerings”).\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\nDue to the growth in our cloud-based solutions, service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements.\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising.\nReportable Segments\nThe segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other.\nIn June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nWe expect to report the financial performance of LinkedIn as part of our Productivity and Business Processes segment.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\nSUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\n2016\n2015\n2014\nPercentage Change 2016 Versus 2015\nRevenue Gross margin Operating income Diluted earnings per share\n$ 85,320 $ 52,540 $ 20,182 2.10 $\n$ 93,580 $ 60,542 $ 18,161 1.48 $\n$ 86,833 $ 59,755 $ 27,759 2.63 $\n(9)% (13)% 11% 42%\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nRevenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other.

Current year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $0.69, and favorably impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation, which resulted in an increase to diluted EPS of $0.05. Diluted EPS was $1.48 for fiscal year 2015. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease to diluted EPS of $1.15.\n32\nPercentage Change 2015 Versus 2014\n8% 1% (35)% (44)%\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nRevenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, primarily due to higher revenue from More Personal Computing and Intelligent Cloud.

Expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%.\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nGeneral and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year.\nIMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES\nImpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our phone business, employee severance expenses and costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and other business integration expenses associated with our acquisition of NDS.\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nImpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of asset impairment charges related to our phone business. We also recorded $480 million of restructuring charges, including employee severance expenses and contract termination costs, primarily related to our previously announced phone business restructuring plans.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our phone business. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing our Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our Phone Hardware reporting unit intangible assets. All remaining goodwill and intangible assets are included in our Devices reporting unit, within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities. Integration expenses associated with the acquisition of NDS were $435 million in fiscal year 2015.\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nImpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015, compared to $127 million for fiscal year 2014. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses for fiscal year 2015 are comprised mainly of impairment and restructuring charges of $7.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, related to our phone business. Integration expenses increased $308 million, due to a full-year of integration activities in fiscal year 2015 associated with the acquisition of NDS.\n39\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nThe components of other income (expense), net were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nDividends and interest income Interest expense Net recognized gains on investments Net losses on derivatives Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements Other\n2014 $ 903 $ 766 $ 883 (597) 437 (328) (165) (169)\n2016\n2015\n(1,243) 668 (443) (121) (195)\n(781) 716 (423) 335 (267)\nTotal\n$\n(431) $ 346 $\n61\nWe use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nDividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. Other-than-temporary impairments were $322 million in fiscal year 2016, compared with $183 million in fiscal year 2015. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts. For fiscal year 2016, other reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures.\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nDividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $183 million in fiscal year 2015, compared with $106 million in fiscal year 2014. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in fiscal year 2015 as compared to gains in fiscal year 2014, offset in part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts. For fiscal year 2015, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.\nINCOME TAXES\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries including the impact of net\n40\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nrevenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss before income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. In fiscal year 2015, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion. Impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 U.S income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $8.9 billion.\nOn July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. The IRS’s decision to appeal on February 19, 2016 prolongs the uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the Altera case, and we do not expect to adjust our consolidated financial statements until there is a final resolution of this case.\nTax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing.\nWhile we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\nChanges in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply\n41\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nthe Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $113.2 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $96.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. Equity and other investments were $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed- income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\nOf the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2016, $108.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. As of June 30, 2016, approximately 83% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in foreign securities.\nSecurities lending\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $294 million as of June 30, 2016. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2016 were $361 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.\nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\nCash Flows\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nCash flows from operations increased $3.7 billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets.\nFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014\nCash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion to $29.7 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.7 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets.\nDebt\nWe issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2016 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2016 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2016:\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ending,\nSeptember 30, 2016 December 31, 2016 March 31, 2017 June 30, 2017 Thereafter\nTotal\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. This share repurchase program replaced the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired on September 30, 2013. As of June 30, 2016, $7.1 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by December 31, 2016. All repurchases were made using cash resources.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 294 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $14.8 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $13.2 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares for $6.4 billion; 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013, and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired September 30, 2013.\nDividends\nSee Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n44\n$ 10,194 8,348 5,868 3,058 6,441\n$ 33,909\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016:\n(In millions)\n2017\n2018-2019\n2020-2021\nThereafter\nTotal\nLong-term debt:\n(a)\nPrincipal payments Interest payments\nConstruction commitments Operating leases Purchase commitments (d) Other long-term liabilities\n(c)\n(e)\n(b)\n$\n0 $\n1,289 1,809 961 13,214 0\n5,050 $ 5,250 $ 30,649 $ 40,949 22,996 2,547 1,971 162 1,918 6,464 19,078 1,102 385 87\n2,324 0 1,467 758 23\n16,836 0 2,118 4,004 275\nTotal contractual obligations\n$ 17,273 $ 10,866 $ 9,822 $ 53,882 $ 91,843\n(a) See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (b) (c) (d)\nThese amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements. These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above.\n(e) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $13.0 billion\nfrom the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items.\nOther Planned Uses of Capital\nIn June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash. We expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, and we will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt.\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\nLiquidity\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n45\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nShould we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nSee Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.\nMicrosoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.\nIn January 2015, we announced Windows 10 would be free to all qualified existing users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made\n46\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\navailable for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the Windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.\nCustomers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.\nWe currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue recognition, which we anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nImpairment of Investment Securities\nWe review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n47\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.\nThe Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\nThe Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.\nSatya Nadella Chief Executive Officer\nAmy E.

Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer\n49\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7A\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRISKS\nWe are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Currency\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.\nInterest Rate\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage- backed securities.\nEquity\nOur equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.\nCommodity\nWe use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.\nVALUE-AT-RISK\nWe use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.\nThe VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.\n50\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 7A\nThe following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the year ended June 30, 2016:\n(In millions)\nJune 30, 2016\nJune 30, 2015\nYear Ended June 30, 2016\nRisk Categories\nForeign currency Interest rate Equity Commodity\n92 $ $ 58 $ 157 12 $\n$ 120 $ 51 $ 149 13 $\nAverage $ 171 $ 56 $ 163 10 $\nHigh $ 258 $ 63 $ 178 14 $\nLow\n83 $ $ 50 $ 137 6 $\nTotal one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $225 million as of June 30, 2016 and $237 million as of June 30, 2015. The total VaR is 29% less as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nITEM 8.

Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.\nSegment Information\nIn June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 – Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).\n57\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\nService revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements.\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nMicrosoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.\nRevenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.\nTechnology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.\nSoftware updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all\n58\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nrevenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.\nCustomers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.\nCertain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.\nSome volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.\nRevenue related to Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.\nDisplay advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\nProduct Warranty\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected\n59\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for stock awards is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n60\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\n\nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.\n\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nWe measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.\nOur other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.\nEquity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.\nWe lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative\n61\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nevidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nBalance, beginning of period\nCharged to costs and other Write-offs\n2014 $ 335 $ 301 $ 336 16 (51)\n2016\n2015\n146 (55)\n77 (43)\nBalance, end of period\n$ 426 $ 335 $ 301\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory\n62\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nIntangible Assets\nAll of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nRecently adopted accounting guidance\nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted.\nWe elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of July 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.\nWe elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.\n63\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nAdoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital of $402 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented upon adoption.\nWe elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the guidance changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported results as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30, 2015\nAs adjusted\nAs reported\nBalance sheets:\nCurrent deferred income tax assets Other long-term assets Other current liabilities Long-term deferred income tax liabilities\n0 $ 1,915 $ $ 3,117 $ 2,953 $ 6,555 $ 6,766 $ 1,295 $ 2,835\nRecent accounting guidance not yet adopted\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available- for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.\nThe new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue standard. Our ability to early adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.\n64\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nWe anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office, retail, and datacenter operating leases.\nFinancial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations.\nThe guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented.\nThe new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.\nWe anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud offerings, and professional services to remain substantially unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather than over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing.\nWe currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard.\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.\n65\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nThe components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:\n(In millions, except earnings per share)\nYear Ended June 30,\nNet income available for common shareholders (A)\nWeighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) Dilutive effect of stock-based awards\n2014 $ 16,798 $ 12,193 $ 22,074 8,299 100\n2016\n2015\n7,925 88\n8,177 77\nCommon stock and common stock equivalents (C)\n8,013\n8,254\n8,399\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic (A/B) Diluted (A/C)\n$ $\n2.12 $ 2.10 $\n1.49 $ 1.48 $\n2.66 2.63\nAnti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.\nNOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nThe components of other income (expense), net were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nDividends and interest income Interest expense Net recognized gains on investments Net losses on derivatives Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements Other\n2014 $ 903 $ 766 $ 883 (597) 437 (328) (165) (169)\n2016\n2015\n(1,243) 668 (443) (121) (195)\n(781) 716 (423) 335 (267)\nTotal\n$\n(431) $ 346 $\n61\nFollowing are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nOther-than-temporary impairments of investments Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities\n2016 $ (322) 1,376 (386)\n2015 $ (183) 1,176 (277)\n2014\n$ (106) 776 (233)\nTotal\n$\n668\n$\n716\n$ 437\n66\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nNOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS\nInvestment Components\nThe components of investments, including associated derivatives, but excluding held-to-maturity investments, were as follows:\n(In millions)\nCost Basis\nUnrealized Gains\nUnrealized Losses\nRecorded Basis\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nShort-term Investments\nEquity and Other Investments\nJune 30, 2016\nCash Mutual funds Commercial paper Certificates of deposit U.S. government and agency securities Foreign government bonds Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Corporate notes and bonds Municipal securities Common and preferred stock Other investments\n$\n3,501 $ 1,012 298 1,000 89,970 5,502 4,789 6,509 285 5,597 590\n0 $ 0 0 0 245 10 21 110 57 4,452 0\n0 $ 0 0 0 (11) (18) (2) (35) 0 (236) 0\n3,501 $ 1,012 298 1,000 90,204 5,494 4,808 6,584 342 9,813 590\n3,501 $ 1,012 298 868 100 731 0 0 0 0 0\n0 $ 0 0 132 90,104 4,763 4,808 6,584 342 0 (3)\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9,813 593\nTotal\n$ 119,053 $ 4,895 $ (302) $ 123,646 $ 6,510 $ 106,730 $ 10,406\n(In millions)\nCost Basis\nUnrealized Gains\nUnrealized Losses\nRecorded Basis\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nShort-term Investments\nEquity and Other Investments\nJune 30, 2015\nCash Mutual funds Commercial paper Certificates of deposit U.S. government and agency securities Foreign government bonds Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Corporate notes and bonds Municipal securities Common and preferred stock Other investments\n$\n3,679 $ 1,100 1 906 72,843 5,477 4,899 7,192 285 6,668 597\n0 $ 0 0 0 76 3 23 97 35 4,986 0\n0 $ 0 0 0 (30) (24) (6) (37) (1) (215) 0\n3,679 $ 1,100 1 906 72,889 5,456 4,916 7,252 319 11,439 597\n3,679 $ 1,100 1 776 39 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 $ 0 0 130 72,850 5,456 4,916 7,252 319 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11,439 589\nTotal\n$ 103,647 $ 5,220 $ (313) $ 108,554 $ 5,595 $ 90,931 $ 12,028\nAs of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $767 million and $561 million, respectively.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.\nOur derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.\n68\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nForeign Currency\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively.\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both periods.\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.\nEquity\nSecurities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.\nInterest Rate\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.\nIn addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million, respectively.\nCredit\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nCommodity\nWe use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and $316 million, respectively.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2016, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.\n70\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”) and not designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated hedge derivatives”).

The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted- average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.\nNokia’s Devices and Services Business\nOn April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the “Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\n(In millions)\nCash Accounts receivable Inventories Other current assets Property and equipment Intangible assets Goodwill Other Current liabilities Long-term liabilities\n(a)\n(b)\nTotal purchase price\n(a) (b)\nGross accounts receivable was $901 million, of which $147 million was expected to be uncollectible.

The impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement. See Note 10 – Goodwill and Note 11 – Intangible Assets for additional details.\nIn May 2016, we announced an agreement to sell our entry-level feature phone assets for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nOur consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.\nFollowing are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012:\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nYear Ended June 30,\nRevenue Net income Diluted earnings per share\nThese pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.\nCertain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.\nOther\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we completed 17 acquisitions for total cash consideration of $1.4 billion. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.\nPro forma results of operations for Mojang and our other acquisitions during the current period have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\n76\n2014\n$ 96,248 $ 20,234 2.41 $\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nNOTE 10 — GOODWILL\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30, 2014\nAcquisitions\nOther\nJune 30, 2015\nAcquisitions\nOther\nProductivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud More Personal Computing\n$\n6,116 $ 4,631 9,380\n376 $ 291 1,788\n(183) $ (5) (5,455)\n6,309 $ 4,917 5,713\n443 $ 549 100\n(74) $ 1 (86)\nTotal goodwill\n$ 20,127 $ 2,455 $ (5,643) $ 16,939 $ 1,092 $ (159) $ 17,872\nThe measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.\nAny change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the above table. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge was included in “Other,” as discussed below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nOur accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11.3 billion.\nAs discussed in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. This resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer- based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.\nNo instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2016 test.\nUpon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.\nBecause our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology,\n77\nJune 30, 2016\n6,678 5,467 5,727\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\npatent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.\nNo other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test.\nNOTE 11 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:\n(In millions)\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nJune 30,\nTechnology-based Marketing-related Contract-based Customer-related\n(a)\n$ 5,970 1,869 796 465\n$\n(3,648) (616) (718) (385)\n$\n2016 2,322 1,253 78 80\n$ 5,926 1,942 1,192 492\n$\n(3,149) (508) (710) (350)\nTotal\n$ 9,100\n$ (5,367)\n$ 3,733\n$ 9,552\n$ (4,717)\n(a)\nTechnology-based intangible assets included $115 million and $116 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we corrected our intangible assets in the table above for a $585 million misstatement between gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2015. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the Devices reporting unit within our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to intangible assets in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in the Devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.\nThese intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nWe estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.\n78\nNet Carrying Amount\n2015\n$\n2,777 1,434 482 142\n$ 4,835\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nThe components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:\n(In millions)\nAmount\nWeighted Average Life\nAmount\nYear Ended June 30,\nTechnology-based Marketing-related Customer-related\n2016\n$ 361 2 30\n4 years $ 1 year 3 years\n2015 874 543 37\nTotal\n$ 393\n4 years $ 1,454\nIntangible assets amortization expense was $978 million, $1.3 billion, and $845 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

As of June 30, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted- average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.\nWe have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 1, 2016 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements.

Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30,\n2016\nDeferred Income Tax Assets\nStock-based compensation expense Other expense items Restructuring charges Unearned revenue Impaired investments Loss carryforwards Depreciation and amortization Other revenue items\n$\n809 1,609 284 494 226 1,703 115 89\nDeferred income tax assets\nLess valuation allowance\n5,329 (2,180)\nDeferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$ 3,149\nDeferred Income Tax Liabilities\nForeign earnings Unrealized gain on investments and debt Depreciation and amortization Other\n$ (1,242) (2,102) (1,008) (54)\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n(4,406)\nNet deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\n$ (1,257)\nReported As\nOther long-term assets Long-term deferred income tax liabilities\n(a)\n(a)\n$\n219 (1,476)\nNet deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\n(a)\n$ (1,257)\n(a) Balances as of June 30, 2015 reflect the impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard in fiscal year 2016 related to balance sheet\nclassification of deferred taxes.

This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nUnrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8 billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million, $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes.\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nBalance, beginning of year\nDecreases related to settlements Increases for tax positions related to the current year Increases for tax positions related to prior years Decreases for tax positions related to prior years Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations\n$\n2015 2014 9,599 $ 8,714 $ 8,648 (583) (201) 566 1,086 217 115 (95) (317) (39) (118)\n2016\n(50) 1,091 94 (144) (106)\nBalance, end of year\n$ 10,164 $ 9,599 $ 8,714\nWhile we settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n83\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nNOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nPhone Hardware Integration\nIn July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our company’s overall strategy (the “Phone Hardware Integration Plan”). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were completed as of June 30, 2015.\nIn connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015.\nPhone Hardware Restructuring\nIn June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the “Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.\nIn fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2016.\n2016 Restructuring\nWe periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.\nIn connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur additional charges for these restructuring plans in subsequent years.\nRestructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21– Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nChanges in the restructuring liability were as follows:\n(In millions)\nSeverance\nOther\n(a)\nRestructuring liability as of June 30, 2015\nRestructuring charges Reversal of prior year restructuring charges Cash paid Other\n$\n588 372 0 (466) (24)\n$ 249 129 (21) (112) (6)\nRestructuring liability as of June 30, 2016\n$\n470\n$ 239\n(a)\n“Other” primarily reflects activities associated with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing operations, including contract termination costs and asset write-downs.\n84\nTotal\n$ 837 501 (21) (578) (30)\n$ 709\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nNOTE 15 — UNEARNED REVENUE\nUnearned revenue by segment was as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30,\nProductivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud More Personal Computing Corporate and Other\n2015 $ 12,482 $ 11,643 10,346 3,246 83\n2016\n11,472 3,246 6,709\nTotal\n$ 33,909 $ 25,318\nRevenue from Windows 10 is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other in the table above. As of June 30, 2016, we deferred a net $6.6 billion in revenue related to Windows 10.\nNOTE 16 — COMMITMENTS\nConstruction and Operating Lease Commitments\nWe have committed $2.0 billion for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2016.\nWe have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases was $1.0 billion, $989 million, and $874 million, in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June 30, 2016 are as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ending June 30,\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter\n$\n961 996 922 833 634 2,118\nTotal\n$ 6,464\nOther Commitments\nOn June 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”) for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash (the “Merger Agreement”). We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in the 2016 calendar year, subject to approval by LinkedIn’s shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.\n85\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nNOTE 17 — CONTINGENCIES\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nIPCom patent litigation\nIPCom GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions.\nInterDigital patent litigation\nInterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied.\nEuropean copyright levies\nWe assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007 pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France.\nOther patent and intellectual property claims\nIn addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2016.\nAntitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions\nAntitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nThe trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs are expected to file their case in chief in August 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support. A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive.\nOther Antitrust Litigation and Claims\nChina State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation\nIn 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues.\nProduct-Related Litigation\nU.S. cell phone litigation\nNokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\nIn 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to hear en banc. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal.\nCanadian cell phone class action\nNokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.\nOther\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\n87\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nIndemnifications\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 18 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nShares Outstanding\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nBalance, beginning of year\nIssued Repurchased\n2014 8,027 8,239 8,328 86 (294) (295) (175)\n2016\n2015\n75\n83\nBalance, end of year\n7,808 8,027 8,239\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.

Participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary, subject to certain limitations. Beginning January 2016, we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year.

Matching contributions for all plans were $549 million, $454 million, and $420 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and were expensed as contributed.\nNOTE 21 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nIn its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP.\nIn June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\nOur reportable segments are described below.\nProductivity and Business Processes\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nOffice Commercial, including volume licensing and subscriptions to Office 365 commercial for products and services such as Office,\nExchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”).\n\nOffice Consumer, including Office sold through retail or through an Office 365 consumer subscription, and Office Consumer Services,\nincluding Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.\n\nDynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics CRM Online.\n91\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nServer products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs,\nas well as Azure.\n\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\nMore Personal Computing\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nWindows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system, volume licensing of the Windows operating system, patent licensing, Windows Embedded, MSN display advertising, and Windows Phone licensing.\n\nDevices, including Surface, phones, and PC accessories.\n\nGaming, including Xbox hardware; Xbox Live, comprising transactions, subscriptions, and advertising; video games; and third-party\nvideo game royalties.\n\nSearch advertising.\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.\nSegment revenue and operating income (loss) were as follows during the periods presented:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nRevenue\nProductivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud More Personal Computing Corporate and Other\n$ 26,487 $ 26,430 $ 26,976 21,735 38,460 (338)\n25,042 40,460 (6,669)\n23,715 43,160 275\nTotal revenue\n$ 85,320 $ 93,580 $ 86,833\n92\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 8\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nOperating income (loss)\nProductivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud More Personal Computing Corporate and Other\n$ 12,461 $ 13,359 $ 14,173 8,446 5,605 (465)\n9,358 6,142 (7,779)\n9,871 4,667 (9,736)\nTotal operating income\n$ 20,182 $ 18,161 $ 27,759\nCorporate and Other operating income (loss) includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to U.S. GAAP, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

These amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.\nAssets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington July 28, 2016\n95\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 9, 9A\nITEM 9.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016; their report is included in Item 9A.\n96\nTable of Contents\nPART II Item 9A\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 of the Company and our report dated July 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington July 28, 2016\n97\nTable of Contents\nPART II, III Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\nITEM 9B.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 14 and 16 of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares) which may be awarded and delivered under the Plan shall not exceed the sum of (a) any Shares available for future awards, as of the Effective Date, under the Microsoft Corporation 1991 Stock Option Plan, as amended (“1991 Stock Plan”) and (b) any Shares that are represented by awards under the 1991 Stock Plan which, after the Effective Date, are forfeited, expire, are cancelled without delivery of Shares, or otherwise result in the return of Shares to the Company, minus (c) 100,000,000 Shares (unadjusted for any stock split or stock dividend with respect to the Shares).

Administration of the Plan.\n(a) Procedure. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(i) The Board of Directors may appoint one or more Committees each consisting of not less than two members of the Board of Directors to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Once appointed, such Committees shall continue to serve until otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.\n(ii) From time to time the Board of Directors may increase the size of the Committee(s) and appoint additional members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, or fill vacancies however caused.\n(iii) The Committee(s) appointed to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors may delegate its authority to administer the Plan to the extent provided in the charter for the Committee(s) or a resolution of the Board.\n(b) Powers of the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to grant Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Awards, and SARs; (ii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(b) of the Plan, the fair market value of the Shares; (iii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per share of Awards to be granted; (iv) to determine the Participants to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted and the number of Shares to be represented by each Award; (v) to interpret the Plan and the terms of Awards; (vi) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; including the form of Award Agreement, and manner of acceptance of an Award, (vii) to determine the terms and provisions of each Award to be granted (which need not be identical) and, with the consent of the Awardee, modify or amend any Award; (viii) to authorize conversion or substitution under the Plan of any or all Conversion Options; (ix) to accelerate or defer (with the consent of the Awardee) the vesting or exercise date of any Award; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Award previously granted by the Board; and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; provided that, no consent of an Awardee is necessary under clauses (vii) or (ix) if the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral, in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit on the Awardee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 14.\nThe Board may, but need not, determine that an award shall vest or be granted subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals. Performance goals for awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board and will be designed to support the business strategy, and align executives’ interests with customer and shareholder interests. For awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), performance goals will be based on one or more of the following business criteria: sales or licensing volume, revenues, customer satisfaction, expenses, organizational health/productivity, earnings (which includes similar measurements such as net profits, operating profits and net income, and which may be calculated before or after taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization or taxes), margins, cash flow, shareholder return, return on equity, return on assets or return on investments, working capital, product shipments or releases, brand or product recognition or acceptance and/or stock price. These criteria may be measured: individually, alternatively or in any combination; with respect to the Company, a subsidiary, division, business unit, product line, product or any combination of the foregoing; on an absolute basis, or relative to a target, to a designated comparison group, to results in other periods or to other external measures; and including or excluding items that could affect the measurement, such as extraordinary or unusual and nonrecurring gains or\nlosses, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, material changes in tax laws, acquisitions or divestitures, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, asset write-downs, restructuring charges, or the results of discontinued operations.\n(c) Effect of Board’s Decision. All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Participants and Awardees.\n5. Eligibility.\n(a) Awards may be granted to Participants and to persons to whom offers of employment as an Employee have been extended; provided that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are Employees or Consultants.\n(b) The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the “Maximum Annual Participant Award”) shall not exceed 20,000,000 Common Shares for Options or SARs, or 5,000,000 shares for Stock Awards (increased, in both cases proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares). If an Option is in tandem with an SAR, such that the exercise of the Option or SAR with respect to a Share cancels the tandem SAR or Option right, respectively, with respect to each Share, the tandem Option and SAR rights with respect to each Share shall be counted as covering but one Share for purposes of the Maximum Annual Participant Award.\n6. Options.\n(a) Each Option shall be designated in the written or electronic option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.\n(b) For purposes of Section 6(a), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.\n(c) Options converted or substituted under the Plan for any or all outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights held by employees, consultants, advisors or other option holders granted by entities subsequently acquired by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company (“Conversion Options”) shall be effective as of the close of the respective mergers into, or acquisitions of such entities by, the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; provided that such Conversion Options may not be exercised during any periods that may be specified by the Company immediately following the close of the merger or acquisition necessary to ensure compliance with applicable law. The Conversion Options may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that stock appreciation rights in the acquired entity shall only be converted to or substituted with Nonqualified Stock Options. The Conversion Options shall be options to purchase the number of Common Shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of the acquired entity’s common stock underlying each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the closing of such merger or acquisition by the number specified in the applicable merger or acquisition agreement for conversion of each share of such entity’s common stock to a Common Share (the “Merger Ratio”), rounded down to the closest whole share. Such Conversion Options shall be exercisable at an exercise price per Common Share (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of the acquired entity’s common stock under each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to closing divided by the Merger Ratio. No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of Conversion Options. In lieu of such issuance, the Common Shares issued pursuant to each such exercise shall be rounded to the closest whole Share. Conversion Options may be granted and exercised without the issuance of an Award Agreement.\n7. Stock Awards.\n(a) Stock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. After the Committee determines that it will offer a Stock Award, it will advise the Awardee in writing or electronically, by means of an Award Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions,\nincluding vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the Awardee shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the time within which the Awardee must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Award Agreement in the manner determined by the Committee; provided that Shares may be issued to an Awardee under a fully vested Stock Award without the issuance of an Award Agreement.\n(b) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Common Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the Awardee ceasing to be a Participant. To the extent that the Awardee purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the Awardee ceases to be a Participant, the cessation of Participant status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Common Share paid by the Awardee.\n8. SARs.\n(a) The Committee shall have the full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant SARs to selected Awardees. The Committee is authorized to grant both tandem stock appreciation rights (“Tandem SARs”) and stand-alone stock appreciation rights (“Stand- Alone SARs”) as described below.\n(b) Tandem SARs.\n(i) Awardees may be granted a Tandem SAR, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying Section 6 Option for Common Shares or the surrender of the Option in exchange for a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the fair market value (on the Option surrender date) of the number of Shares in which the Awardee is at the time vested under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (B) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested Shares.\n(ii) No such Option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Committee, either at the time of the actual Option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distributions to which the Awardee shall become entitled under this Section 8(b) may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the Option surrender date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.\n(iii) If the surrender of an Option is not approved by the Committee, then the Awardee shall retain whatever rights he or she had under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the Option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the later of (A) five (5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (B) the last day on which the Option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such Option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than ten (10) years after the date of the Option grant.\n(c) Stand-Alone SARs.\n(i) An Awardee may be granted a Stand-Alone SAR not tied to any underlying Option under Section 6 of the Plan. The Stand-Alone SAR shall cover a specified number of Common Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish. Upon exercise of the Stand-Alone SAR, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate fair market value (on the exercise date) of the Common Shares underlying the exercised right over (B) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares.\n(ii) The number of Common Shares underlying each Stand-Alone SAR and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Stand-Alone SAR is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the grant date.\n(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.\n(d) The Common Shares underlying any SARs exercised under this Section 8 shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.\n9. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date. It shall continue in effect until terminated under Section 17 of the Plan.\n10. Term of Award; Limitations on Vesting and Repricing.\n(a) The term of each Award shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.\n(b) Each Award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, provided that Awards covering up to 50,000,000 shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event) may be granted without regard to the 3-year vesting restriction; provided further, that Conversion Options and awards that are granted or vest based on performance goals or that vest in less than three (3) years based on death, disability, or retirement shall not count toward the limit of this Section 10(b).\n(c) Without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, no Award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, repurchased for cash or other consideration, or modified (except in connection with an adjustment pursuant to Section 14), in each case if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the Shares underlying such Award.\n11. Exercise Price and Consideration.\n(a) The per Share exercise price under each Award shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:\n(i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option\n(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.\n(B) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.\n(ii) Except for Conversion Options under Section 6(c), the per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or any other provision of the Plan), Options and SARs that are granted to Employees who are non-exempt for purposes of the FLSA, shall satisfy the requirements for exclusion from regular rate of pay for purposes of the FLSA and shall have an exercise price that is at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the underlying Shares at the time of grant; furthermore, such Options or SARs shall not be exercisable within the six (6) month period immediately following the date of grant, except, if so provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of the Awardee’s death, disability, or retirement, upon a change in corporate control of the Company, or under such other circumstances as are permitted under the FLSA or rules and regulations thereunder.\n(iii) The maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under this Plan is 50,000,000 Shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, or stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares); provided that Conversion Options shall not count against the limit of this Section 11(a)(iii).\n(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) on the date of grant. If the Shares cease to be listed on Nasdaq, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.\n(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds\nnecessary to pay the exercise price. If the Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the officer may, in addition, be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price with Shares which, as of the exercise date, the officer has owned for six (6) months or more. If the Awardee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.\n(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Award, the Awardee shall pay any federal, state, and local income and employment tax withholding obligations applicable to such Award. If an Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld.\n12. Exercise of Award.\n(a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Award granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.\nAn Award may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.\nAn Award shall be deemed to be exercised when written or electronic notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 11(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.\nExercise of an Award in any manner and delivery of the Shares subject to such Award shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Award, by the number of Shares as to which the Award is exercised.\n(b) Termination of Status as a Participant. In the event of termination of an Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant, such Awardee may exercise his or her rights under any outstanding Awards to the extent exercisable on the date of termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Award as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise his or her rights under such Awards at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such rights within the time specified in the individual Award Agreements, the Awards shall terminate, except as otherwise may be provided in the Award Agreement.\n(c) Disability of Awardee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of termination of an Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months) (i) the Awardee is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity, or (ii) the Awardee has received income replacement benefits for at least three months under an accident and health plan covering Company employees):\n(i) Any outstanding but unvested Stock Award shall become immediately vested (unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement); and\n(ii) Any outstanding Option or SAR shall vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee remained in Continuous Status as a Participant for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(c) must be exercised within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise such Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Award shall terminate. This Section 12(c) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion Option.\n(d) Death of Awardee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of the death of an Awardee:\n(i) who is at the time of death a Participant with an outstanding Stock Award, all unvested shares under any outstanding Awards shall become immediately vested (unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement). Such shares may be claimed by the Awardee’s estate or by a person who acquired the right to the shares by bequest or inheritance within twelve (12) months following the date of death. Any right to shares not claimed within twelve (12) months from the date of death shall be canceled.\n(ii) who is at the time of death a Participant with an outstanding Option or SAR, the Option or SAR will vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as a Participant twelve (12) months following the date of death. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(d)(i) may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee’s estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Award by bequest or inheritance; or\n(iii) whose Option or SAR has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as a Participant terminated prior to the date of death, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee’s estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had vested at the date of termination.\nThis Section 12(d) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion Option.\n(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this Section 12, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding Option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Award beyond the date on which the Award would have expired if no termination of the Employee’s Continuous Status as a Participant had occurred).\n13. Non-Transferability of Awards. An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Awardee, only by the Awardee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.\n14. Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan. If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company’s receipt of consideration, appropriate\nadjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award, (iv) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under the Plan, and (v) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Awards with a vesting period of less than three years. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(v) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 14, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 14, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.\nIn the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Award shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Awardee the right to exercise an Award as to all or any part of the Shares subject to an Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or to substitute an equivalent award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Awardee to have the right to exercise the Award as to all of the Shares subject to Awards, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Award fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Awardee that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period.\n15. Time of Granting Awards. The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of such Award and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the grant, exercise or vesting of an Award shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Participant to whom an Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.\n16. Substitutions and Assumptions. The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.\n17. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.\n(a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company’s ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 14 of the Plan, and any amendment described in Section 10(c) of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.\n(b) Participants in Foreign Countries. The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.\n(c) Effect of Amendment or Termination. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 14, any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Awards already granted and such Awards shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Awardee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Awardee and the Company.\n18. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.\n19. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.\n20. No Employment/Service Rights. Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to an Award or to continue in service as an Employee or Consultant for any period of specific duration, or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining such person), or of any Participant or Awardee, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person’s services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.\nAll share numbers in the Plan reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effected February 2003.\nExhibit 12\nCOMPUTATION OF RATIOS OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES\n(In millions, except ratios)\nYear Ended June 30,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\nEarnings Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes Add: Fixed charges Add: Cash distributions from equity method investments Subtract: Income (loss) from equity method investments\n(a)\n$ 19,751 $ 18,507 $ 27,820 $ 27,052 $ 22,267 435 74 27\n1,326 12 (25)\n867 1 (78)\n674 54 (152)\n489 71 (99)\nTotal Earnings\n$ 21,114 $ 19,453 $ 28,700 $ 27,711 $ 22,749\nFixed Charges Interest expense Capitalized debt related expenses Interest component of rental expense\n(b)\n$\n1,185 $ 58 82\n756 $\n25 86\n577 $\n20 77\n394 $\n35 60\n345 35 55\nTotal Fixed Charges\n$\n1,325 $\n867 $\n674 $\n489 $\n435\nRatio of Earnings to Fixed Charges\n16\n22\n43\n57\n52\n(a) Earnings represent earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and before income (losses) from equity method investments\n(b)\nplus: (1) fixed charges; and (2) cash distributions from equity method investments.

The increase in gross margin also reflects higher full-price product margins across wholesale and NIKE Direct.

Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing investments.

Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of “Organic revenue growth,” “Core” and “Constant currency.”\n2\nGuidance and Outlook\nThe Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are\nincluded in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity\nmark-to-market net impacts.\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Company now expects to deliver 8 percent organic revenue growth (previously 6\npercent), and 9 percent core constant currency EPS growth (previously 8 percent).\nConsistent with its previous guidance for 2023, the Company continues to expect:\nA core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and\n\nTotal cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.7 billion, comprised of dividends of $6.7\nbillion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.\nIn addition, the Company continues to expect an approximate 2-percentage-point foreign exchange\ntranslation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market\nconsensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.27 (previously $7.20), a 7 percent\nincrease (previously 6 percent) compared to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast\nAt approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on April 25, 2023, the Company will post prepared\nmanagement remarks (in pdf format) of its first quarter 2023 results and business update, including its\noutlook for 2023, at www.pepsico.com/investors.

We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\nMark-to-market net impact\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nRestructuring and impairment charges\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nA - 6\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\nImpairment and other charges/credits\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\nOther impairment charges\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n2023 guidance\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 Weeks Ended March 25, 2023 (unaudited)\n12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023\nImpact of\nImpact of\nNet Revenue Year over Year % Change Frito-Lay North America Quaker Foods North America PepsiCo Beverages North America Latin America Europe Africa, Middle East and South Asia Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region Total (a)\nReported % Change, GAAP Measure\n15 % 9 % 8 % 21 % 5 % 2 % (1) % 10 %\nForeign exchange translation\n— 1 — (6) 5 28 6 2.5\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n— — 3 1 4 — — 2\nOrganic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(b)\n16 % 10 % 12 % 16 % 14 % 29 % 4 % 14 %\nOrganic volume(c) — (5) (3) 1 (9) (2) 2 (2)\nEffective net pricing 16 15 15 15 23 31 2.5 16\n(a) Acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflect the Juice Transaction in PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe.

We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\nMark-to-market net impact\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nRestructuring and impairment charges\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nA - 6\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\nImpairment and other charges/credits\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\nOther impairment charges\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n2023 guidance\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 Weeks Ended March 25, 2023 (unaudited)\n12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023\nImpact of\nImpact of\nNet Revenue Year over Year % Change Frito-Lay North America Quaker Foods North America PepsiCo Beverages North America Latin America Europe Africa, Middle East and South Asia Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region Total (a)\nReported % Change, GAAP Measure\n15 % 9 % 8 % 21 % 5 % 2 % (1) % 10 %\nForeign exchange translation\n— 1 — (6) 5 28 6 2.5\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n— — 3 1 4 — — 2\nOrganic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(b)\n16 % 10 % 12 % 16 % 14 % 29 % 4 % 14 %\nOrganic volume(c) — (5) (3) 1 (9) (2) 2 (2)\nEffective net pricing 16 15 15 15 23 31 2.5 16\n(a) Acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflect the Juice Transaction in PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth shown here differs from the volume change disclosed in the Summary First-Quarter 2023 Performance table on page 2, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE.

Business\nOverview\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include:\nOne-of-a-kind Assortment. We offer guests a differentiated assortment of more than 25,000 products from more than 600 well- established and emerging beauty brands across a variety of categories and price points. We believe we offer the widest selection of beauty categories, including prestige and mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, prestige and mass skincare, bath and body products, professional hair products, and salon styling tools.\nStore Footprint. We operate more than 1,350 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations. With a bright and open store environment, we make it easy for guests to discover new products and services. Our store design, fixtures, and open layout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. We also offer beauty services in nearly every store, including a full-service hair salon and a BenefitTM Brow Bar. In addition to our free-standing locations we have more than 350 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shops which provide guests with a highly-curated, prestige beauty assortment in a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space within certain Target locations.\nLeading Digital Experiences. Through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications, we offer guests convenient, interactive and personalized digital experiences. Our digital channels enable always-on shopping and discovery, and our diverse fulfillment options, including buy online pick-up in store, buy online pick-up curbside, ship from store, ship from distribution center, and same-day delivery, provide guests with value and convenience. In addition to e-commerce platforms, we offer guests a variety of unique digital experiences, including virtual try-on and skin analysis tools, which leverage augmented reality capabilities and artificial intelligence tools to provide guests with personalized experiences.\nBest-in-Class Loyalty Program. Our best-in-class loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services at Ulta Beauty, through purchases on our private label and co-branded credit cards, and purchases at Ulta Beauty at Target. In addition to unique membership benefits, members can redeem points for discounts on any product or service at Ulta Beauty. With more than 95% of total sales coming from members, we are uniquely positioned with a deep understanding of our customers and their preferences, enabling us to personalize experiences, recommendations, and promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform and support our brand partners’ growth.\nGreat Guest Experiences. We cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels. Our knowledgeable and approachable store associates, our differentiated service offerings, and our efforts to create relevant, compelling digital content are competitive advantages and enable us to build strong engagement with guests.\nWe were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We estimate beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 65% of shoppers and account for more than 80% of beauty products and services spend in the U.S.\n2\nTable of Contents\nThe following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur strategy\nWe target beauty enthusiasts across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors. Beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty, and historically, this connection has not diminished in softer economic environments. Our proprietary consumer research confirms engagement with the beauty category remains strong. Despite the unprecedented disruption and sustaining effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers demonstrated their commitment to beauty as they resumed in-person shopping with enthusiasm, while also maintaining some of their online shopping behaviors, however the operational and competitive landscape remains dynamic, and persistent cost pressures, including supply chain and labor costs, remain a challenge.\nReflecting our understanding about how the consumer and beauty category are evolving, in 2021 we refreshed our strategic framework to position Ulta Beauty for continued success. We are focused on six key strategic pillars designed to expand our market leadership and drive longer-term profitable growth.\nDrive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Beauty enthusiasts enjoy the experience of discovering and trying new products and increasingly include beauty as part of their self-care and wellness journey. Reflecting these insights, our objective is to engage and continuously delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, differentiated, inclusive assortment focused on leading beauty and self-care trends. We are focused on four key areas: maximizing growth in core categories, including makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance; driving growth of cross-category strategic platforms, including Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®, Black- owned and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)-founded Brands, the Wellness Shop, and SPARKED at Ulta Beauty; differentiating our assortment through exclusive brands and products, including our private label, Ulta Beauty Collection; and increasing profitability through assortment management, inventory productivity, and promotional optimization.\nEvolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World. Our guest insights and member data confirm that beauty enthusiasts prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. At the same time, digital channels offer convenience, product reviews, and price transparency. As a result, the guest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels. To drive greater guest engagement across all channels, we intend to expand our physical footprint, continue to differentiate our service offerings, and grow our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities while further enhancing our digital and mobile experiences and driving competitive advantage through digital innovation. Our objective is to deliver a cohesive, industry-leading omnichannel experience that drives breakthrough engagement with our guests and unlocks the combined potential of our physical and digital channels.\nExpand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey, solidifying Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community. To understand longer-term shifts in consumer values, perceptions, and behaviors, as well as of-the-moment insights, we have developed a robust consumer research capability. In addition, with more than 95% of total sales coming from our 40.2 million active Ultamate Rewards loyalty program members, we have unique insights about customer preferences and behavior. Based on our proprietary insights, we know beauty enthusiasts have an emotional, personal, and deep connection with beauty. Social media contributes to this connection, and we expect the influence and reach of beauty will continue to grow as engagement with social platforms increases. To expand Ulta Beauty’s reach, relevancy, and guest engagement, we intend to amplify our brand purpose; build a creator and content ecosystem to deliver compelling, relevant beauty entertainment; drive further innovation in our Ultamate Rewards program; and use our member data to increase personalization, drive conversion, and support our brands. Our vision is to expand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey to increase consumer acquisition and drive guest engagement, loyalty, and share of wallet.\nDrive operational excellence and optimization. Similar to other retailers, we are experiencing persistent cost pressures from macroeconomic trends, including rising wage rates and higher transportation and shipping costs. In addition, we anticipate ongoing headwinds from channel and category mix shifts. To mitigate the impact of these pressures and\n3\nTable of Contents\nsupport our future growth, we have developed a continuous improvement capability to identify and activate meaningful, cross-functional process optimization opportunities; we are upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform to increase efficiency and support future growth; and we are enhancing our supply chain network to increase agility, speed and cost-efficiency. Our vision is to deliver profitable growth and competitive advantage by optimizing our cost structure to enable scale, developing agile operating processes that enable real- time visibility and decision-making, and building new capabilities tailored to win in a rapidly evolving omnichannel world.\nProtect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. We have developed and nurtured a guest and associate-centric, values-based and high-performance culture. These tenets are core to how we lead, how we engage with our guests and partners, and how we make decisions. We value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking, and we respect and listen to our associates to continually improve as a company. We have an experienced leadership team and passionate associates committed to living our values while caring for our guests and for each other. To support our growth and enhance the guest experience, we will continue to attract, develop and retain talent at all levels and in all functional areas, and we will continue to work to create an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute and have an opportunity to grow.\nExpand our environmental and social impact. As a leader in the beauty industry, we have an opportunity to drive positive impact. We believe that beauty is for everyone, regardless of age, size, ability, skin tone, culture, or gender, and we strive to provide an environment where every associate feels they can realize their full potential and every guest is optimally served, regardless of differences. We empower and inspire guests to make informed and sustainable product choices through our unique Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® platform, and we strive to protect the beauty of our natural environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by managing our stores’ energy, water, and waste footprints. We are committed to making the world a better place, and we are focused on driving sustainable change in areas where we can make the biggest impact and committed to collaborating with others to address shared challenges.\nOur market\nWe operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. In 2022, this market represented approximately $172 billion in sales, according to forecasted Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. In 2022, the beauty products industry totaled approximately $104 billion and included cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 9% share of the $104 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. In 2022, the salon services industry totaled approximately $68 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry. We have full-service hair salons in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores, as well as makeup services through our salons. In addition, we offer skin services in approximately 150 locations.\nCompetition\nOur major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and the online capabilities of national retailers and brands, as well as pure-play e-commerce companies. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons.\nOur retail channels\nWe are committed to meeting guests where and how they want to shop and strive to offer guests a compelling, personalized shopping experience through our stores, digital platform, and partnerships.\n4\nTable of Contents\nStores\nOur member data suggests our guests prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. In our fiscal year ended January, 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022), 76% of our loyalty members transacted with us solely in one of our stores. Our retail stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power strip centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our retail store concept, including physical layout, displays, lighting, and quality of finishes, has changed over time to reflect the rising expectations of our guests and our evolving merchandising and operating strategies.\nWe offer a full range of beauty services in our stores, focusing on hair, makeup, brow, and skin services. Our current Ulta Beauty store format includes an open and modern salon area, with most of our stores offering brow services on the salon floor. In addition, stores offering skin services include a skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area on the sales floor. The salon features a concierge desk, approximately five to ten stations, and a shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ highly skilled, licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer services as well as educational experiences, including consultations, styling lessons, makeup applications, skincare regimens, and at-home care recommendations.\nIn addition to opening new stores, we also remodeled and relocated certain stores, as shown in the following table:\nFiscal year ended\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 29,\n2023\n2022\nTotal stores beginning of period\nStores opened Stores closed\nTotal stores end of period\n1,308 47 – 1,355\n1,264 48 (4) 1,308\nTotal square footage Average square footage per store\n14,200,403 10,480\n13,770,438 10,528\nStores remodeled Stores relocated\n20 12\n9 7\nOur real estate vision is to make Ulta Beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets, and is a key driver of how we plan to expand our market share over time. We believe that over the long term, we have the potential to grow our store footprint to between 1,500 to 1,700 freestanding Ulta Beauty stores in the United States.\nWe leverage a variety of insights to identify the best new store locations and optimize our current store locations, including beauty market share information and insights from our loyalty members. This insight-led, analytical approach to site selection has resulted in a high performing real estate portfolio. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $1.7 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to enhance and evolve our in-store experience to best engage our guests, we are introducing a new layout in our new and remodeled stores. While our traditional layout is organized by price point, with prestige makeup and skincare on one side of the store and mass makeup and skincare on the other, our new layout brings together like categories with intuitive adjacencies to magnify our differentiated assortment. In the new layout, categories flow from prestige to mass with delineated fixturing showcasing each segment. In addition, we are adding several features including elevated gondolas to showcase key, iconic, and service brands and new Beauty Bars that offer our brow and makeup services as well as supporting in-store events and highlight beauty-in-action. We believe this new layout better reflects how our guests shop and will simplify exploration and shopping.\n5\nJanuary 30,\n2021\n1,254 30 (20) 1,264\n13,291,838 10,516\n– 5\nTable of Contents\nDigital platform\nIn addition to store expansion, we continue to expand our digital capabilities as more of our guests choose to engage with us across physical and digital platforms. In fiscal 2022, 17% of our loyalty members shopped both in Ulta Beauty stores and through our digital platforms. Our e-commerce platform has two key roles: generating direct channel sales and profits by communicating with our guests in an interactive, enjoyable way that reinforces the Ulta Beauty brand; and driving traffic to our stores, website, and native applications. Our omnichannel guests are extremely valuable, historically spending nearly three times as much as retail-only guests. We continue to develop and add new website and mobile features and functionality, marketing programs, new products and brands, and omnichannel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a leading online beauty resource by providing our guests with a unique, rich online experience, with information on key trends and products, editorial content, expanded assortments, interactive experiences, including virtual try-on capabilities, and social media content.\nWe continue to improve our order fulfillment capabilities with increased speed of delivery through existing distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers (e-commerce only), and select retail stores, through more efficient processes designed for e-commerce order fulfillment, and starting in 2023, our first market fulfillment center. In addition to ship to home order fulfillment, we offer guests “Buy Online, Pick-up in Store,” “Curbside Pickup,” and “Store 2 Door,” which provides the ability for customers to order in-store and have products delivered to their homes. In addition, we offer same-day delivery for e-commerce orders in select markets.\nPartnerships\nTo expand our reach and introduce new guests to Ulta Beauty, we have formed a long-term partnership with Target Corporation to create Ulta Beauty at Target, a “shop-in-shop” concept that offers a curated assortment of more than 60 established and emerging prestige brands across a variety of categories. Co-designed by Ulta Beauty and Target, the Ulta Beauty at Target shop is intended to reflect the Ulta Beauty experience with a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space separate but adjacent to Target’s core beauty department. The shop is staffed by Target team members who are trained by Ulta Beauty to provide recommendations and answer product questions. Members in our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, can earn points (but not redeem) for purchases made in the Ulta Beauty at Target shop. Loyalty points can only be redeemed in Ulta Beauty stores, on Ulta.com or through our mobile applications. As of January 28, 2023, Ulta Beauty at Target was available in over 350 Target locations and on target.com. Over time, we expect Ulta Beauty at Target to be in up to 800 Target locations, in addition to our freestanding Ulta Beauty stores.\nMerchandising\nStrategy\nWe offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. Across our stores, Ulta.com and our mobile applications, we offer more than 25,000 products from more than 600 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. Our merchandising team continually monitors beauty and fashion trends, historical sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty’s product assortment fresh and relevant and to ensure that our assortment reflects the diversity of our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderately-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.\nCertain beauty enthusiasts are growing more interested in choosing products that support their own personal well-being and the well-being of workers, animals, communities, and the environment, and they are increasingly supporting brands whose products and actions align with their own values. Reflecting the growing importance of these trends, in fiscal 2020 we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® in all stores, on Ulta.com, and on our mobile applications. This holistic initiative provides transparency for guests to help them choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. Through this initiative, we certify brands and products across four key pillars, Clean Ingredients, Cruelty Free, Vegan, and Sustainable Packaging, and recognize brands for their positive impact on our\n6\nTable of Contents\ncommunity. Displayed in stores on an endcap constructed of recycled and recyclable materials, the program launched with 187 brands. As of January 28, 2023, more than 300 brands participated in the program, with more than half certified in more than one pillar. As part of the launch, we published our “Made Without List,” an evolving ingredient standard for clean beauty products, and established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development, and packaging sustainability. With the help of our Advisory Council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change.\nDuring the past few years consumers have increased their focus on self-care. Based on internal proprietary research, approximately 65% of consumers see the beauty category as being significantly connected to wellness. In response to this trend, we launched The Wellness Shop in select stores and online that offers an assortment of products across six platforms: everyday care, supplements and ingestibles, relax and renew, down there care, spa at home, and intimate wellness (online only).\nWe have a long tradition of being a diversity-forward company. We aspire to be beauty at its most inclusive and have made several important commitments across our marketing, assortment, and training efforts to ensure guests, associates, partners, and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty and are able to discover beauty on their own terms. During fiscal 2022, we increased our assortment of Black-owned and Black-founded brands by 34% with the addition of 12 Black-owned and Black-founded brands, supporting our progress towards our commitment to dedicate 15% of our brand assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands over time.\nWe believe our private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection, is a strategically important opportunity for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of Ulta Beauty as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas that enhance our brand image. The Ulta Beauty Collection has been certified in the Clean Ingredients and Cruelty Free pillars within the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® program. We also offer products such as Tarte Double Duty Beauty cosmetics, IT Brushes for Ulta Beauty, and CHI for Ulta Beauty hair care appliances that are permanently exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Similarly, we offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Colourpop, Juvia’s Place, Chanel and Florence. The Ulta Beauty Collection and permanent Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 4% of our total net sales in fiscal 2022. Both permanent and temporary exclusive products represented approximately 10% of our total net sales in fiscal 2022.\nCategories\nWe offer a balanced portfolio across six primary categories: (1) cosmetics; (2) haircare products and styling tools; (3) skincare; (4) fragrance and bath; (5) services; and (6) accessories and other, which includes other revenue sources such as the private label and co- branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nThe following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributed to each category for the periods presented:\nFiscal year ended\n(Percentage of net sales) Cosmetics Haircare products and styling tools Skincare Fragrance and bath Services Accessories and other\nJanuary 28, 2023 42% 21% 17% 14% 3% 3% 100%\nJanuary 29, 2022 43% 20% 17% 14% 3% 3% 100%\n7\nJanuary 30, 2021 45% 20% 16% 12% 3% 4% 100%\nTable of Contents\nOrganization\nOur merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising Officer who oversees the Senior Vice President of Cosmetics and category Vice Presidents who in turn oversee Divisional Merchandise Managers and their teams of buyers. Our Chief Merchandising Officer also oversees our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure consistent execution across our omnichannel platforms and our planogram team.\nIn stores, we present products in an open-sell environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our planogram team assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis, and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends. Our visual team works with our merchandising team to develop strategic placement of promotional merchandise, functional and educational signage, and creative product presentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive centrally produced promotional merchandising planners to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs.\nPlanning and allocation\nWe have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts, and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis.\nBrand partnerships\nWe have strong, active relationships with our brand partners. Our top ten brand partners, such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder Companies, among others, represented 56% and 54% of our total net sales in fiscal 2022 and our fiscal year ended January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2021), respectively. We believe our brand partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement, and we work closely with them to market both new and existing brands.\nAll brand partners and respective subcontractors and their facilities are subject to the applicable Ulta Vendor Standards, which set forth the ethical, legal, social, and workplace standards to meet in order to do business with Ulta Beauty. In addition to complying with Ulta Vendor Standards, many brand partners have committed to help advance our mission to maintain the beauty of our environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by offering sustainable packaging. We have made a commitment that 50% of packaging from products sold at our stores will be recyclable, refillable, or made from recycled or bio-sourced materials by 2025.\nMarketing and advertising\nWe employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores, website, and mobile applications, acquire new loyalty program members, improve guest retention, increase frequency of shopping, and increase spend per member. We communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including print advertising, digital and social media, television and radio. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and services, and special offers, as well as build our emotional connection with guests. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances Ulta Beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, supports our charitable efforts related to the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events, and new store openings.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe Ultamate Rewards loyalty program is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated analysis of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns and day-to-day communications. Our data demonstrates that loyalty members spend more per visit as compared to non-members. Ultamate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases at Ulta Beauty stores, through our digital platforms, and at Ulta Beauty at Target. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell or service we provide in Ulta Beauty stores or through our digital platforms. To enhance our loyalty program, we offer co- branded and private label credit cards. The credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members, provide increased consumer insights, and offer attractive economics. Furthermore, we continue to expand our gift card program to increase distribution in our store and online channels and to retail locations in store and online through partnerships with third parties.\nWe are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense towards digital, social media, and streaming advertising. We believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as driving consideration amongst those who have not yet shopped with us. Our marketing program has been effective in communicating with our existing online, mobile, and retail guests in a targeted and relevant way. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us increase brand awareness and consideration among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests.\nRetail media network\nWe have a deep understanding of our Ultamate Rewards loyalty members and their preferences. This unique understanding combined with our ongoing investment in data analytics and CRM capabilities enables us to create personalized experiences and value for our guests and has unlocked new ways for us to support our brand partners and drive additional vendor income. As we look to elevate our position as the premier beauty retailer, in May 2022 we launched our retail media network, UB Media, to transform the way our brand partners can connect with beauty enthusiasts. UB Media offers brands a suite of media capabilities that aim to personalize guest engagement and drive the acquisition of new guests.\nStaffing and operations\nRetail stores\nOur current Ulta Beauty store format is typically staffed with a general manager, a services manager, and three associate managers, along with approximately 28 full- and part-time associates, including approximately four to eight prestige consultants and five to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the General Manager. The General Manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring, and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various performance metrics. Each General Manager reports to a District Manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to a Senior Vice President of Stores, who in turn reports to the Chief Operating Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally based talent development managers, a field loss prevention team, service district educators and service district leaders, and brand partners.\nUlta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, typically eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season.\n9\nTable of Contents\nSalon services\nA typical salon is staffed with five to ten licensed salon professionals, including six or more stylists, and select stores have an esthetician. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our services district educators and brand partner education classes create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 6,800 Ulta Beauty salon professionals.\nSupply chain\nOur vision is to build and operate a dynamic and agile end-to-end supply chain that improves operational efficiency, performance, and guest experience to fuel organizational growth in an effective way. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new store and e-commerce growth. We operate four distribution centers that support both stores and e-commerce demand, and two fast fulfillment centers that support e-commerce orders only. In addition, 115 stores fulfill e-commerce orders as part of our ship-from-store program. Starting in fiscal 2023, we are introducing a fourth type of facility, a market fulfillment center, which will focus on our most productive products and support ecommerce sales and store demand, enabling us to improve service and responsiveness, especially in markets with high store and population density.\nInventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers. We replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers use warehouse management software systems to manage inventory to support product purchase decisions. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers.\nHuman capital management\nWe believe our associates, with their combined skills, knowledge, experiences, and commitment to serving our guests, are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do, and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity in our daily actions.\nThe following table sets forth the approximate number of associates employed as of January 28, 2023:\nFull-time Part-time Total associates\nWe have no collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relationships with our associates.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nOur goal is to create an inclusive environment where every associate feels he or she can be his or her authentic self and every guest is optimally served, regardless of differences. A critical way we achieve this is by educating all associates on the lived experiences of their peers and key moments in time that have cultural or heritage significance, as well as the unconscious beliefs and biases that shape our behavior today. We embed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts through a cross-functional approach, led by our Chief Executive Officer, to ensure teams remain energized and motivated to lead in this critical space and integrate DEI in all that we do. We accomplish this through inclusive recruitment strategies, dedicating time to celebrate intersectionality and types of diversity that are not otherwise formally recognized, encouraging associates to build personal habits through everyday inclusive actions, and managing a diverse leaders program to empower, inspire, and educate high-potential diverse associates.\nIn addition, we aim to ensure that all in-store experiences are equitable, fair, and unbiased. We take action to support this goal by conducting quarterly mandatory trainings for in-store associates and providing weekly learning opportunities to\n10\n18,500 34,500 53,000\nTable of Contents\nfocus on guest perspectives and reinforce key takeaways. We offer similar training across the organization to help key decision-makers and associates in their own learning journeys and support our Champion Diversity value and inclusion competency. In fiscal 2022, associates participated in our Inclusion in Action training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.\nThe following table sets forth key metrics as of January 28, 2023:\nBoard of\nWomen Men People of color\nDirectors 55% 45% 36%\nLeadership 66% 34% 27%\nOversight and management\nWe strive to make sure that our associates are at the heart of every decision we make. The Chief Human Resources Officer, along with the entire executive team, is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, and engagement of talent and the design of associate compensation and benefits programs. Our human capital objectives and initiatives, including the risks related to compensation policies and practices, management development and leadership succession, DEI policies and practices, and implementation and compliance monitoring of our code of business conduct, are also overseen by individual Board committees as described in our corporate governance guidelines.\nWe believe open and honest two-way communication is critical to maintaining strong associate engagement. We regularly conduct an associate engagement survey to take the pulse of associates’ satisfaction with their roles, their leaders, and the Company as a whole, which our executive team reviews and monitors. Our leadership team also hosts roundtable sessions to dive deeper on specific topics as well as additional forums, including department town halls, store and distribution center visits, and other small group gatherings.\nTraining and development\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement opportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates, and outside hires to support our new stores. The majority of our promotions are internal. As we continue to promote and develop from within, we are building a bench of associates and leaders who know our business inside and out and support our values-driven culture.\nAll of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty’s mission, vision, and values. Through our learning management system and our digital workplace system, we provide continuing education to associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Additionally, our leadership development program prepares promising future leaders for new levels of responsibility.\nCompensation and benefits\nOur commitment to our associates and their well-being is one of our highest priorities. We have assembled a suite of benefits that affirms and supports all that our associates contribute every day, including:\nHealth care coverage is offered to those who work more than 30 hours a week in any position. Coverage extends to eligible dependents, including spouses, domestic partners, and children under the age of 26. We offer comprehensive medical plans that empower associates to choose the coverage that best suits them.\n401(k) plan with up to a 4% company match. ● Disability and life insurance. ● Company-paid short-term disability pay at 80% of pay.\n11\nAll Other\nAssociates 91% 9% 53%\nTable of Contents\nAdditional insurance options, including legal, pet, home, and auto. ● Tuition reimbursement program. ● Paid time off, including an extended illness bank. ● Discounts on retail products and salon services.\nIn addition, we believe wellness, like beauty, is more than skin deep, so we offer mental health resources, such as counseling services and access to mobile applications, financial wellness planning and guidance, and health mobile applications and educational resources for soon- to-be parents.\nThe Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation (UBCF) supports the Associate Relief Program to assist associates facing unforeseen financial hardship. The Associate Relief Program provides short-term financial support to reimburse medical bills or support temporary housing.\nSustainability\nWe strive to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. Our retail stores are focused on energy reduction efforts by maintaining safe indoor air for all customers while products are being used in our salons, using adequate energy-efficient lighting, managing the in-store temperatures, and making efficient use of water needed for our salon services. In addition, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our carbon footprint by investments in renewable energy credits and working with our brand partners to identify ways to work together to reduce Scope 3 emissions.\nInformation technology\nWe are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies (including cloud technologies) to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS, e-commerce, marketing, finance, accounting, and human resources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate together and with our internally developed software solutions. Our technology also includes a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores, and our distribution center infrastructure and provides communications for continual polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level.\nWe manage data security and privacy at the highest levels. Our Board of Directors is actively engaged in oversight of cybersecurity, and it is part of the charter of our Audit Committee. Our Chief Information Officer and Chief Executive Officer keep the Board informed on cybersecurity and privacy matters throughout the year. Our Security Operations Center constantly and proactively monitors our network and application landscape for threats and anomalies. We have established processes for sharing data and performing third-party risk assessment and regular disaster recovery planning and response readiness testing. Our security approach also includes multiple layers of defense and testing of controls. We have strengthened our data protection capabilities through investments and training. All Ulta Beauty associates have a role as stewards of company data, and we educate them on how to keep data safe. As part of our annual code of business conduct training, we train associates on how to keep devices and data safe in public places; how to avoid security threats and phishing scams; how to maintain a secure workplace; and everyday practices that help maintain the security of corporate digital devices, data and systems.\nWe intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. In fiscal 2021, we began a multi-year upgrade of our enterprise resource planning platform which will provide a flexible and scalable operating environment allowing for greater business efficiency. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate growth and enhance our competitive position.\nIntellectual property\nWe have registered trademarks in the United States and other countries. The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Beauty and two related designs, Ulta.com and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics &\n12\nTable of Contents\nFragrance (and design). We maintain our marks and monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and other countries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.\nWe believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta Beauty brand, “All Things Beauty. All In One Place. ®”, “The Possibilities are Beautiful®”, “21 Days of Beauty®”, and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®” have significant value and are important to building brand recognition.\nGovernment regulation\nWe are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations, and other constraints exist at the federal, state, or local levels in the United States. The products we sell, such as cosmetics (including products with cannabidiol), dietary supplements, food, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, and styling tools, including our Ulta Beauty branded products, may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state regulatory agencies, and State Attorneys General (State AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, advertising, and distribution of the products. In addition, the salon services provided in our stores may be subject to state and local regulations.\nCosmetics, OTC drugs, medical devices, and dietary supplements have specific regulatory requirements, including but not limited to ingredient, labeling, manufacturing, and holding requirements. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the FDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g., blow dryers and curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements including the requirement to report certain product defects. The labeling and packaging of all of these products may also be subject to the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and state specific requirements.\nFurther, statements we make in advertising, including statements about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing, and environmental claims, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, which generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices.\nFederal, state, municipal, and local labor and employment statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, mandates, and taxation laws, to which most retailers are typically subject, also impact our day-to-day operations. We are also subject to typical governmental and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services operations are subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements.\nIn our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary governmental approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site, and we also ask them to obtain any governmental approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining governmental approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). As applicable, we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. If required by the municipality, we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAvailable information\nOur principal website address is www.ulta.com. We make available at this address under investor relations (at https://ulta.com/investor), free of charge, our proxy statement, annual report to shareholders, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information available on our website is not incorporated by reference in and is not deemed a part of this Form 10- K. In addition, our filings with the SEC may be accessed through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all forward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not assume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future growth. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment in our common stock.\nBusiness, Operational and Strategic Risks\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores on a profitable basis. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans, long-range strategic imperatives and/or operational excellence priorities, including continuous improvement, Project SOAR (our replacement enterprise resource planning platform) and supply chain optimization, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decrease.\nWe believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:\nrecognize and define product and beauty trends; ● anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer preferences (including relating to sustainability of product sources and packaging, ingredient transparency, and animal welfare) in a timely manner;\ntranslate market trends into appropriate, saleable product, and service offerings in our stores and salons in advance of our competitors;\ndevelop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms; and ● distribute merchandise to our stores in an efficient and effective manner and maintain appropriate in-stock levels.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer, our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n14\nTable of Contents\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our distribution and fast fulfillment centers could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with direct-to-store arrangements from vendors or wholesalers. We are a retailer carrying over 25,000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends, which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure. Any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure, such as disruptions in our information systems, disruptions in operations due to fire, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, inventory availability, or shipping and transportation problems, could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, shipping and transportation costs represent a component of our cost structure and an increase in shipping and transportation costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur e-commerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe offer most of our beauty products for sale through our Ulta.com website and through our mobile applications. As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors. Additionally, omnichannel retailing continues to rapidly evolve, and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors. As we continue to grow our e-commerce platform, the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests, conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores, and opening up our channels to increased competition from pure-play e-commerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant guest- facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreased costs or interruption in our third-party vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment, or receipt of some of our merchandise, which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\nWe directly source the majority of our Ulta Beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products through third-party vendors using foreign factories. In addition, many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products. Any event causing a disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries, including the imposition of import restrictions, geopolitical events, unanticipated political changes, increased customs duties, and legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products, could result in substantial disruptions in our supply chain (including inventory availability) and materially harm our operations. We have no long-term supply contracts with respect to such foreign-sourced items, many of which are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States from such countries. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad, such as political instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes, and local business practices. Our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health\n15\nTable of Contents\nconcerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas, or acts of war or terrorism, to the extent these acts affect the production, shipment, or receipt of merchandise. Our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors, and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe rely on our good relationships with brand partners to purchase prestige, mass, and salon beauty products on reasonable terms, and to offer certain brands or products that are permanently or temporarily exclusive to us. If these relationships were to be impaired, or if certain brand partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms, and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe have no long-term supply agreements with brand partners and, therefore, our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our brand partners. Our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our brand partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores. Some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands, which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners, or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, merchandise supplied to Ulta Beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 56% and 54% of our net sales, respectively. There continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry. The loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors, or by any of our other brand partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe also offer products that are permanently exclusive to us and offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive to us for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors. If our brand partners ceased granting us permanent or temporary exclusive rights our net sales could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect against inventory shrink, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to effectively manage our inventory. Risk of inventory loss (also called shrink) is inherent in the retail business. We have historically experienced inventory shrink due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes. While some level of inventory shrink is unavoidable, we continue to experience elevated levels of inventory shrink relative to historical levels, which have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. To protect against rising inventory shrink, we have taken, and may continue to take, certain operational and strategic actions that could adversely affect our reputation, guest experience, and results of operations.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOur comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance, including:\ngeneral U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment; ● changes in our merchandising strategy or mix; ● performance of our new and remodeled stores; ● the effectiveness of our inventory management; ● timing and concentration of new store openings, including additional human resource requirements and related pre-opening and other start-up costs;\ncannibalization of existing store sales by new store openings; ● timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities; ● seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions; ● actions by our existing or new competitors; and ● hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes, mudslides, other natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, and geopolitical events.\nAccordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease. In that event, the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our future growth, which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe currently operate four distribution centers, which house the distribution operations for Ulta Beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our e-commerce platform, and two fast fulfillment centers (e-commerce only). To support our expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business, it is likely additional distribution facilities will be added in the future. Our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities. We use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, and print. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs. Further, disruption to certain media channels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based and mobile communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest accounts. As laws and regulations evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees, or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel at all levels, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization. This execution requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts, and abilities of key executive personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Furthermore, our ability to manage our retail expansion requires us to continue to train, motivate, and manage our associates. We also need to attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified executive, managerial, and merchandising personnel and store and distribution center associates. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, especially in light of the labor pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating, and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably. In addition, fluctuations in the cost of labor, including as a result of inflationary pressures on wages, may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to open stores.\nWe have a $1.0 billion secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in March 2025. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement. The credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and repurchase our stock, and merge or consolidate with another entity, and requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the agreement falls below a specified threshold. These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and, in certain circumstances, may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment.\nEconomic, Market and Other External Risks\nMacroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and recessionary concerns, as well as ongoing labor cost pressures, transportation and shipping cost pressures, and the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. For instance, we were negatively impacted in fiscal 2022 by persistent cost pressures, including supply chain and labor costs. We expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2023 and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, recessionary concerns and/or supply chain and labor challenges, as well as the current turmoil in the banking industry, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows.\nAlthough we do not have any operations outside the United States, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related economic sanctions by Western governments on Russia, has caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and exacerbated the inflation situation.\nThe health of the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail\n18\nTable of Contents\nconsumers and premium salon services. Uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories, including prestige beauty products and premium salon services. Factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include: general business conditions, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, levels of employment, interest rates, tax rates, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, and risks related to epidemics or pandemics and geopolitical events. In the event of a prolonged period of inflation, an economic downturn or a recession, consumer spending habits could be adversely affected, and we could experience lower than expected net sales.\nIn addition, a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our brand partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located. A bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Additionally, volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets may have a significant, adverse impact on global economic conditions, resulting in inflationary or recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, which, in turn, may lead to declines in consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers, and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets.\nThe markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, both small and large, including regional and national department stores, specialty retailers, drug stores, mass merchandisers, high-end and discount salon chains, locally owned beauty retailers and salons, online capabilities of national retailers, pure-play e- commerce companies, catalog retailers, and direct response television, including television home shopping retailers and infomercials. We believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise, our value proposition, the quality of our guests’ shopping experience, and the convenience of our stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and salon services. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing, and other resources and therefore, may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition, or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. As a result, we may lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nA reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAs a result of our real estate strategy, most of our stores are located in off-mall shopping areas known as power centers. Power centers typically contain three to five big-box anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants. As a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas, our sales are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores, or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn, an outbreak of flu or other viruses, a general downturn in the local area where our store is located, or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center. Such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We may respond by increasing markdowns, initiating marketing promotions, or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect our business, financial condition, profitability, cash flows and supply chain.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID 19 pandemic. Government authorities have taken measures to try to contain the virus, such as limiting or closing business activities, transportation and person-to-person interactions, resulting in the temporary closing of all of our stores across the U.S. on March 19, 2020. As a result of this decision, we experienced a significant reduction in customer traffic and demand which resulted in our sales and results of operations being negatively impacted in fiscal 2020. While we have reopened all stores and resumed our in-store services, the potential of temporary restrictions in operating hours, in-store services or reclosing of certain stores in the future is possible.\nGlobal trade conditions and customer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have a long-lasting adverse impact on us independently of the progress on the pandemic. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and its various impacts changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products, at least temporarily, due to the closures of offices, retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings, and also resulted in inflationary pressures on wages, transportation and shipping costs, and wholesale costs, recessionary concerns and other evolving macroeconomic conditions. The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, cash flows, and supply chain, although the full extent is still uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nFuture epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, or other catastrophes or crises could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nEpidemics, pandemics, or other public health crises, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides, as well as acts of violence or terrorism, have resulted in the temporary closure of our stores and, in the future, could also result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary reclosing of our stores, the temporary closing of our distribution and fast fulfillment centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products (or a substantial increase in the cost of those products) from domestic or foreign suppliers, the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution and fast fulfillment centers (or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries), the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and/or the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers. Accordingly, if one or more epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, and/or acts of violence or terrorism were to occur in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs.\nOur stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock.\nClimate change might adversely impact our business operations and/or our supply chain.\nScientific consensus shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe. Climatologists predict these changes will result in the increased frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters which could disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers. These weather events could also lead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores. In addition, concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and/or regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the\n20\nTable of Contents\nenvironment. Any such new requirements could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging, as well as our product supply chain and distribution costs.\nThere is also increased focus, including by investors, guests, and other stakeholders, on climate change and other environmental, social, governance (ESG) and sustainability matters, including single use plastic, energy, waste and worker safety. Concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to change, including moving away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably made, and we expect to incur additional costs in connection with our ESG and sustainability initiatives.\nOur reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to these matters and, taken together, these matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows, as well as our ability to meet the needs of our customers.\nInformation Security, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nCybersecurity or information security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest, employee, Company and/or business partners’ information, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability, which could negatively impact our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, and store sensitive and confidential data, including our proprietary business information and that of our guests, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, denial-of-service attacks , break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events. Furthermore, we allow certain of our employees to work remotely, as certain of our third-party service providers also allow, and this remote working environment may increase cybersecurity related risks. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our business, products, and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems, successfully upgrade our information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations, particularly during the holiday season.\nWe are dependent on a variety of information systems, including management, supply chain and financial information, and various other processes and transactions, to effectively manage our business. We also are expanding and upgrading our information systems (including replacing our enterprise resource planning platform through Project SOAR) to support historical and expected future growth. The failure of these projects, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed, or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track, record, and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, the processing of transactions, our ability to receive and process e-commerce orders, and/or the reporting of financial results.\nOur e-commerce operations are increasingly important to our business. The Ulta.com website and our mobile applications serve as an effective extension of Ulta Beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies by exposing potential new customers to the Ulta Beauty brand, product offerings, and enhanced content. As the importance of our website, mobile applications, and e-commerce operations to our business continues to grow, we are increasingly vulnerable to\n21\nTable of Contents\ndowntime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce e-commerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to negative financial consequences, including civil or criminal penalties, and harm our brand and reputation.\nComplex local, state and national laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently (such as those enacted by California and certain other states) and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. Complying with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by guests and other affected individuals, fines, and/or damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nLitigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation, proceedings or claims, including possible fines and penalties, could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation, including potential class action and single-plaintiff litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, consumer claims, security of consumer and employee personal information, contractual relations with suppliers, marketing and infringement of trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could absorb significant management time and/or result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or in the aggregate. Any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nSpecifically, our technologies, promotional products purchased from third-party vendors, and/or Ulta Beauty branded products, or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents, patent applications, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing, or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. The inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIf our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products. The FDA does not currently have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics, but requires safety and efficacy substantiation. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be required to take costly corrective action. In addition, sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products, injunctions against future shipment of products, restitution and disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations, or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe, as well as our vendors, are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels can affect our business. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, a prohibition on the operation of our stores, or a prohibition on the sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products. In particular, failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur large workforce makes us vulnerable to changes in labor and employment laws. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could hurt our profitability and affect our growth strategy.\nOur salon operations are subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulatory and licensing requirements could jeopardize the viability of our salons.\nWe operate stores in California, which has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.\nFuture changes in healthcare reform legislation could significantly impact our business.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, and storage of our vendors’ products and our Ulta Beauty branded products are also subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including FDA, FTC, CPSC, and various state and local agencies, such as State AGs and District Attorneys. If we, our vendors, or the manufacturers of our Ulta Beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties, claims, or product recalls, which could harm our results of operations, our reputation and/or our ability to conduct our business.\nAdditionally, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our Ulta Beauty branded products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or local requirements when we advertise our products (including prices) or services, or engage in other promotional activities, in digital (including social media), television, or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur associates or others may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with our policies and procedures.\nWe are exposed to the risk of misconduct or other improper activities by our associates and third parties such as independent contractors or agents. Misconduct by associates, independent contractors, or agents could include inadvertent or intentional failures to comply with our policies and procedures, the laws and regulations to which we are subject, and/or ethical, social, product, labor, and environmental standards. Our current and former associates or independent contractors may also become subject to allegations of sexual harassment, racial and gender discrimination, or other similar misconduct, which, regardless of the ultimate outcome, may result in adverse publicity that could significantly harm our brand, reputation, and operations. Associate misconduct could also involve improper use of information obtained in the course of the associate’s prior or current employment, which could result in legal or regulatory action and harm to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe regard our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. Our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on “The Possibilities are Beautiful.®,” “Ulta Beauty,” “Ulta,” and other marks incorporating our name and “All Things Beauty. All in One Place®,” “21 Days of Beauty®,” and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®,” copyrights in our website and mobile applications content, rights to our domain name www.ulta.com, and trade secrets and know-how with respect to our Ulta Beauty branded product formulations, product sourcing, sales and marketing, and other aspects of our business, and our digital innovations such as try-on applications and artificial intelligence. As such, we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, suppliers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights for any reason (including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights), or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be impaired, and we could lose customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we license certain of our trademarks to some of our business partners. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our business partners covering, among other things, use of our brand name, the value of our brand and our reputation could be impaired to the extent that our business partners do not operate their businesses, including their stores or websites, in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a business partner, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, cash flows and reputation.\nOur Ulta Beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nUnexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our Ulta Beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services, which may have been performed negligently, could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services. Such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. These events could cause negative publicity regarding our Company, brand, or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions include:\ndividing our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; ● authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock without stockholder approval;\nprohibiting stockholder actions by written consent; ● prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; and ● requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified exceptions. Together, these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nItem 1B.

[Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels – department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We estimate beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 65% of shoppers and 80% of beauty products and services spend in the U.S. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance.\nToday, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of more than 25,000 beauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than 1,350 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels.\nThe continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities: 1) drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty; 2) evolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World; 3) expand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey, solidifying Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community; 4) drive operational excellence and optimization; 5) protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent; and 6) expand our environmental and social impact. We believe the attractive and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the expanding definition of beauty and the role that omnichannel capabilities play in consumers’ lives, coupled with Ulta Beauty’s competitive strengths, position us to capture additional market share in the industry.\nComparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.\nOver the long term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel capabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.\n31\nTable of Contents\nCurrent Trends\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe closely monitor the continuing impact of COVID-19 on all facets of our business. While operations during fiscal 2022 did not appear to be negatively impacted, the COVID-19 pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic could have negative impacts in the future. The extent of the impact of the pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic on our future business and financial results will depend on, among other things, the potential of temporary restrictions on operating hours, in-store services or reclosing of certain stores or other facilities of ours or our brand partners and other suppliers, supply chain disruptions, increased transportation and shipping costs, higher wholesale costs, increased labor costs, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact of the foregoing on consumer spending.\nIndustry trends\nOur research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its various impacts changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products, at least temporarily, due to the closures of offices, retail stores, and other businesses and the significant decline in travel, entertainment and social gatherings. The overall beauty market declined in 2020, stabilized in 2021, and expanded in 2022, as consumers resumed in-person shopping while maintaining some of their online shopping behaviors. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\nAlthough we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our sales during fiscal 2022, continued pressure from inflation or other evolving macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and could lead to a recession. Furthermore, inflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with higher costs. In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any future debt.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non- comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. Comparable sales\n32\nTable of Contents\ninclude retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\nthe general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels; ● the introduction of new products or brands; ● the location of new stores in existing store markets; ● competition; ● our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences; ● the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and ● the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.\nCost of sales includes:\nthe cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; ● distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance;\nshipping and handling costs; ● retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses;\nsalon services payroll and benefits; and ● shrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nOur cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include:\npayroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees; ● advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; ● occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; ● stock-based compensation expense; ● depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and\nlegal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nImpairment, restructuring and other costs include long-lived asset impairment charges, restructuring costs associated with store closings, costs associated with the suspension of our Canadian expansion, and employee related severance costs.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.\n33\nTable of Contents\nInterest (income) expense, net includes both interest income and expense. Interest income represents interest from cash equivalents and short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates.\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.\nResults of operations\nOur fiscal years are the 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company’s fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022), January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2021), and January 30, 2021 (fiscal 2020) were all 52-week years.\nAs of January 28, 2023, we operated 1,355 stores across 50 states.

The net sales increase was primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation, increased social occasions and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021, and an increase of $77.3 million in other revenue. The total comparable sales increase of 15.6% in fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, was driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $676.0 million, or 20.1%, to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2022, compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 39.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to:\n100 basis points of leverage of fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales and ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts;\n60 basis points of leverage in other revenue primarily due to credit card income growth, an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target, and higher loyalty point redemptions; and\n20 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; partially offset by ● 70 basis points of deleverage in inventory shrink; and ● 50 basis points of deleverage in merchandise margins driven by brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in fiscal 2021, partially offset by the timing of retail price changes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $333.8 million, or 16.2%, to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 40 basis points to 23.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021. The leverage of SG&A expenses was primarily due to:\n80 basis points of leverage due to lower marketing expenses; and ● 20 basis points of leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales; partially offset by ● 40 basis points of deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments; and ● 20 basis points of deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses increased $1.1 million, or 11.4%, to $10.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021.\nInterest (income) expense, net\nInterest income, net was $4.9 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.7 million of interest expense, net in fiscal 2021. Interest income represents interest from cash equivalents and short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $401.1 million in fiscal 2022 represents an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to fiscal 2021 income tax expense of $310.0 million and an effective tax rate of 23.9%. The higher income tax expense is primarily due\n35\nTable of Contents\nto less tax benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and an increase in state tax expense compared to fiscal 2021.\nNet income\nNet income increased $256.6 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $676.0 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $333.8 million increase in SG&A expenses and $91.1 million increase in income taxes.\nFiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $2.5 billion, or 40.3%, to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $6.2 billion in fiscal 2020. The net sales increase was primarily due to the favorable impact from stronger consumer confidence, government stimulus payments, and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, and an increase of $15.1 million in other revenue. The total comparable sales increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of 17.9% in fiscal 2020, was driven by a 30.0% increase in transactions and a 6.0% increase in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $1.4 billion, or 72.8%, to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021, compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 730 basis points to 39.0% in fiscal 2021 compared to 31.7% in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to:\n300 basis points leverage of fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales; ● 190 basis points of improvements in merchandise margins driven by lower promotional activity and cost optimization efforts; ● 140 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; and ● 100 basis points of leverage in salon expenses attributed to the impact of higher sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $0.5 billion, or 30.2%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 180 basis points to 23.9% in fiscal 2021 compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2020. The leverage in SG&A expenses was primarily due to:\n180 basis points of leverage of corporate overhead due to higher sales; ● 90 basis points of leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales; and ● 50 basis points of leverage of store expenses due to higher sales; partially offset by ● 80 basis points of deleverage due to less employee retention credits received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); and\n60 basis points of deleverage due to higher incentive compensation.\nImpairment, restructuring and other costs\nThere were no impairment, restructuring and other costs recognized in fiscal 2021 compared to $114.3 million for fiscal 2020, which consisted of $41.9 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain retail stores, $29.1 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to Canada, $27.5 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores, and $15.8 million of severance charges.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses decreased $5.5 million, or 36.6%, to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2020 due to current year real estate activity and stores expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net was $1.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $5.7 million of interest expense, net in fiscal 2020. Interest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility. Interest income results from short-term investments. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $310.0 million in fiscal 2021 represents an effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to fiscal 2020 income tax expense of $55.3 million and an effective tax rate of 23.9%. The higher income tax expense is primarily due to higher operating income compared to fiscal 2020.\nNet income\nNet income increased $810.0 million to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $175.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in gross profit and a $114.3 million decrease in impairment, restructuring and other costs, partially offset by a $0.5 billion increase in SG&A expenses and $254.7 million increase in income taxes.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories and cash and cash equivalents reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue. As of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $737.9 million and $431.6 million, respectively.\nOur primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our information technology systems.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease expenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season.\nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.\nWe generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. We believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes contractual cash requirements as of January 28, 2023:\n(In thousands) Operating lease obligations (1) Purchase obligations Total (2)\nTotal $ 2,211,981 111,233 $ 2,323,214\nLess Than 1 Year $ 342,680 63,419 $ 406,099\n1 to 3 Years $ 719,329 46,225 $ 765,554\n3 to 5 Years $ 564,184 1,589 $ 565,773\n(1) These amounts are for our undiscounted lease obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as operating lease liabilities.

Excluded from purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nCash flows\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows during the last three years:\n(In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in financing activities\nJanuary 28, 2023 $ 1,481,915 (314,584) (861,014)\nFiscal year ended January 29, 2022\n$\n1,059,265 (176,484) (1,497,216)\n$\nOperating activities\nOperating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, long-lived asset impairment charges, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 is mainly due to the increase in net income, a smaller increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2022, and the timing of receivable collections, partially offset by the timing of payables and a smaller increase in deferred revenue compared to fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses and income taxes.\nMerchandise inventories, net were $1.6 billion at January 28, 2023, compared to $1.5 billion at January 29, 2022, representing an increase of $104.2 million or 7.0%. The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:\n$54 million increase due to the addition of 47 new stores opened since January 29, 2022; ● $25 million increase due to new key brand launches; and ● $25 million increase primarily due to inventory cost increases.\n38\nMore than 5 Years $ 585,788 — $ 585,788\nJanuary 30, 2021 810,355 (48,751) (107,934)\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the increase in net income and deferred revenue, partially offset by higher merchandise inventories, higher cash outflow from higher income taxes, and lower long-lived asset impairment charges compared to fiscal 2020.\nInvesting activities\nWe have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments, and investments in information technology systems. Investment activities for capital expenditures were $312.1 million during fiscal 2022, compared to $172.2 million during fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to more capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to less proceeds of short-term investments and more capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2020.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table presents a summary of our store activities during the last three years:\nFiscal year ended\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJanuary 29, 2022\nStores opened Stores remodeled Stores relocated\n47 20 12\n48 9 7\nDuring fiscal 2022, the average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store was approximately $1.7 million, which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory net of payables.\nCapital expenditures during the last three years by major category are as follows:\n(In millions) New, Remodeled, and Relocated Stores Merchandising and Refreshed Stores Information Technology Systems Supply Chain Store Maintenance and Other Total\n$\n$\nBudget Fiscal 2023\n156 48 108 113 50 475\n$\n$\nFiscal 2022\n102 34 74 70 32 312\n$\n$\nFiscal 2021\n73 16 37 23 23 172\n$\n$\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems investments, and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures. We expect fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will be up to $475 million and will be used primarily to fund our new, remodeled, and relocated stores and strategic priorities, including investments in information technology systems and supply chain optimization.\n39\nJanuary 30, 2021\n30 – 5\nFiscal 2020\n56 14 36 13 33 152\nTable of Contents\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions. Purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases.\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases offset by an increase in stock option exercises, and no activity under our revolving credit facility.\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including sales demand, overall performance of management initiatives including expense control, and inventory and other working capital reductions. We may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods for unexpected business disruptions, to support our new store program, seasonal inventory needs, or share repurchases.\nShare repurchase program\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2020 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $1.6 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program authorization revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2020 Share Repurchase Program. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\nFiscal year ended\n(Dollars in millions) Shares repurchased Total cost of shares repurchased\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023\n2,192,556 900.0\n$\nJanuary 29, 2022\n4,249,632 1,521.9\n$\nCredit facility\nOn March 11, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party thereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 11, 2025, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $1.0 billion or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and satisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $100.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold.\n40\nJanuary 30, 2021 474,794 114.9\nTable of Contents\nSubstantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Company’s election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.125% or the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.250%, with such margins based on the Company’s borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.20% per annum.\nAs of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nInventory valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be affected by adjustments to these estimates.\nInventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink reserve representing management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. This estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.\nWe do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. An increase or decrease in the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022. An increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink reserve calculation of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022.\n41\nTable of Contents\nVendor allowances\nThe majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendors’ products. We estimate the amount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s analysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors. We record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in receivables. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our reduction of inventory. An increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2022.\nImpairment of long-lived tangible assets\nWe review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable. Assets are primarily reviewed at the store level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. An impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges. During fiscal 2020, we recognized $72.5 million of impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets which consisted of $41.9 million due to the carrying values of certain long-lived assets exceeding their respective fair values, $19.6 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to Canada, and $11.0 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores. No impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nLoyalty program\nWe maintain a customer loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services. Points earned are valid for at least one year. The loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services. Revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire. We defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed. The amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed. The expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends. The standalone selling price of points earned and the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate.\nAdjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. An increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5% would not have a material impact on our operating income in fiscal 2022.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized in full. The estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is\n42\nTable of Contents\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 or January 30, 2021.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee the index, consolidated financial statements, and notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the members of our senior management and Board of Directors.\nBased on management’s evaluation as of January 28, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on\n43\nTable of Contents\nthe criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of January 28, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023 and has issued the attestation report included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we implemented a new payroll system. This implementation resulted in changes to our internal control over financial reporting by automating and accelerating payment processing, reducing the risk of errors, and simplifying payroll management. Implementation of the new payroll system was part of the next phase in a multi-year rollout to upgrade our internal systems. Additional phases of the project will continue to be implemented over the next few years. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting, including evaluating the operating effectiveness of related key controls.\nExcept as described above, there were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

(the Company) as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDescription of the matter\nLoyalty Program The Company maintains a loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, which offers members the ability to earn and redeem points on purchases of products and services. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when members redeem points or points expire. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to defer using the standalone selling price of the points earned and the expected redemption percentage. The Company evaluates its estimated standalone selling price quarterly based on the value of products or services purchased using points. The expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns in conjunction with current information and trends.\nAuditing the Company’s estimate of loyalty deferred revenue was complex as the calculation involved management’s assumptions, such as the standalone selling price and expected redemption rate, which drive the revenue deferral. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to these significant assumptions, which are affected by expectations about future customer behavior.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s estimation process and controls supporting the measurement and recognition of the amount of loyalty revenue deferred. This included testing controls over management’s review of the assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation, the completeness and accuracy of issuance and redemption data used in the calculation, and controls over the assignment of membership levels based on customer spending patterns.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, analyzing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management’s calculation. To test the standalone selling price per point, we validated that the price per point for each membership level was appropriate based on products or services purchased by loyalty members. To audit the redemption rate, we tested redemption activity and compared the results of that testing to the redemption rate used by management in its estimate. In addition, we tested the value of points redeemed was complete and accurate. We also considered recent trends in redemption activity and the impact on the redemption rate. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the deferral amounts.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nChicago, Illinois March 24, 2023\n48\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders’ and the Board of Directors Ulta Beauty, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ulta Beauty, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 and our report dated March 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n49\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois March 24, 2023\n50\nTable of Contents\nUlta Beauty, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands, except per share and store count data)\n1. Business and basis of presentation\nUlta Beauty, Inc. was founded in 1990 to operate specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and related accessories and services. Nearly every store features a full-service salon. As used in these notes and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ulta Beauty,” or the “Company” refer to Ulta Beauty, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All amounts are stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.\nAs of January 28, 2023, the Company operated 1,355 stores across 50 states.\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\nFiscal year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company’s fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022), January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2021), and January 30, 2021 (fiscal 2020) were 52-week years.\nConsolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions, and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management estimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents also include amounts due from third-party financial institutions for credit card and debit card transactions. These receivables typically settle in five days or less with little or no default risk.\n(In thousands) Cash Short-term investments Receivables from third-party financial institutions for credit card and debit card transactions Cash and cash equivalents\n$\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023 651,367 — 86,510 737,877\n$\n$\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. There was no outstanding debt as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022.\nReceivables\nReceivables primarily include amounts due from vendors for allowances, amounts due from third-party gift card providers, royalties and other credit card amounts, and amounts related to the employee retention credit (ERC). The Company does not require collateral on its receivables and does not accrue interest. Credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the diversity of vendors comprising the Company’s vendor base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its vendors and evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the length of time the receivable is past due and historical experience.\n(In thousands) Vendor allowances Gift card Royalties and other credit card Employee retention credit (1) Other Allowance for doubtful accounts Receivables, net\n$\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023 109,899 42,065 19,738 3,760 25,036 (1,076) 199,422\n$\n$\n(1) The Company qualified for various relief measures resulting from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES)\nAct, including the ERC which allowed for a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes on qualified wages. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, there was $4,021 related to the ERC recognized as a reduction of the associated costs within selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\nVendor allowances\nThe Company receives consideration from vendors for advertising, markdown allowances, purchase volume discounts and rebates, reimbursement for defective merchandise, and certain selling and display expenses. Substantially all vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction of the vendor’s product cost and recognized in cost of sales as the product is sold.\n57\nJanuary 29, 2022 165,122 199,939 66,499 431,560\nJanuary 29, 2022 114,853 34,655 11,898 56,426 16,855 (1,005) 233,682\nTable of Contents\nMerchandise inventories\nMerchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods. Inventory cost also includes vendor allowances related to co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. The Company maintains an inventory reserve for lower of cost or net realizable value and shrink. The inventory reserve was $39,532 and $26,882 as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively.\nProperty and equipment and internal use software\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful lives or lease term. Leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term are amortized over the shorter of the assets’ useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nEquipment and fixtures Electronic equipment and software\nCosts incurred to obtain or develop internal use software that are capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.\nCloud computing arrangements\nCloud computing arrangements (software-as-a-service contracts) and related implementation costs that are capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term (1 month to 5 years). These amounts are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets\nThe asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group identified is at the store level and includes both property and equipment and operating lease assets.\nSignificant estimates are used in determining future cash flows of each store over its remaining lease term including our expectations of future projected cash flows including revenues and operating expenses. An impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the long- lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLong-lived tangible and right-of-use assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment quarterly or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed over the asset group. Asset groups are written down only to the extent that their carrying value exceeds their respective fair value. Fair values of the asset group are determined by discounting the cash flows at a rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant. Management’s forecast of future cash flows is based on the income approach. The fair value of individual right-of-use assets is determined under the market approach using estimated market rent assessments based on broker quotes.\nThe determination of fair value under the income approach requires assumptions including forecasts of future cash flows (such as revenue growth rates and operating expenses) and selection of a market-based discount rate. Estimates of market rent are based on non-binding broker quotes. As these inputs are unobservable, they are classified as Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy (see Note 14, “Fair value measurements”). If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, there may be exposure to additional impairment losses in a future period (see Note 4, “Impairment, restructuring and other costs”).\n58\n1 to 10 years 3 to 15 years\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. The recoverability of goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist (see Note 7, “Goodwill”).\nOther intangible assets\nOther definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The recoverability of intangible assets is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable (see Note 8, “Other intangible assets”).\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The lease classification evaluation begins at the lease commencement date. The lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain.\nTotal rent payable is recorded during the lease term, including rent escalations in which the amount of future rent is fixed on the straight- line basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday period beginning upon control of the premises and any fixed payments stated in the lease). For leases with an initial term greater than 12 months, a related lease liability is recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of future payments discounted at the estimated fully collateralized incremental borrowing rate (discount rate) corresponding with the lease term. In addition, a right-of-use asset is recorded as the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to the lessor before or at the lease commencement date and any initial direct costs incurred, less any tenant improvement allowance incentives received. Tenant incentives are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reduction of rent expense over the lease term. The difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent is reflected within the right-of-use asset.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require variable payments based upon sales volume or payment of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes, and insurance related to leases (variable lease cost). Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. This results in some variability in lease expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in stores where variable lease costs are paid. Contingent rent is accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred, in addition to the straight-line rent expense. This results in some variability in lease expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in stores where contingent rent is paid.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recorded on the balance sheet. Short-term lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company subleases certain real estate to third parties for stores with excess square footage space.\nThe Company does not separate lease and non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance).\nAs the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate corresponding with the lease term. As there are no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s credit facility, this rate is estimated based on prevailing market conditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and judgment. The incremental borrowing rate is reassessed if there is a change to the lease term or if a modification occurs and it is not accounted for as a separate contract (see Note 9, “Leases”).\n59\nTable of Contents\nLoyalty program\nThe Company maintains a loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise or services. Points earned are valid for at least one year. The loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be redeemed on future products and services. Revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points expire. The Company defers revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed. The amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed. The expected redemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends. The standalone selling price of points earned and the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period. When a guest redeems points or the points expire, the Company recognizes revenue in net sales on the consolidated statements of income.\nCredit cards\nThe Company has agreements (the Agreements) with third parties to provide guests with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit cards (collectively, the Credit Cards). The private label credit card can be used at any store location and online, and the co-branded credit card can be used anywhere the co-branded card is accepted. A third-party financing company is the sole owner of the accounts and underwrites the credit issued under the Credit Card programs. The Company’s performance obligation is to maintain the Ultamate Rewards loyalty program as only guests enrolled in the loyalty program can apply for the Credit Cards. Loyalty members earn points through purchases at Ulta Beauty, Ulta Beauty at Target, and anywhere the co-branded credit card is accepted.\nThe third parties reimburse the Company for certain credit card program costs such as advertising and loyalty points, which help promote the credit card program. The Company recognizes revenue when collectability is reasonably assured, under the assumption the amounts are not constrained and it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which is generally the time at which the actual usage of the Credit Cards or specified transaction occurs.\nThe Company accounts for the amounts associated with the Agreements as a single contract with the sole commercial objective to maintain the Credit Card programs. As a result, all amounts associated with the Agreements are recognized within net sales on the consolidated statements of income.\nGift card program\nThe Company records a contract liability for gift card sales which will be redeemed in the future within deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net sales when the gift card is redeemed for product or services. Gift cards do not expire and do not include service fees that decrease guest balances. The Company maintains historical data related to gift card transactions sold and redeemed over a significant time frame. Gift card breakage (amounts not expected to be redeemed) is recognized to the extent there is no requirement for remitting balances to governmental agencies under unclaimed property laws. Estimated gift card breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. Gift card breakage revenue was $18,835, $15,266, and $11,717 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the guest, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a guest; ● Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; ● Determination of the transaction price; ● Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and ● Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue.\nRevenue from merchandise sales at retail stores is recognized at the point of sale, net of estimated returns. Revenue from e-commerce merchandise sales is recognized upon shipment to the guest or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria, net of estimated returns. Salon services revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for its single performance obligation related to e-commerce sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. The Company provides refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the point of sale.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs primarily consist of print, digital and social media, and television and radio advertising, net of vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs. Costs related to advertising are expensed in the period the related promotional event occurs.\n(In thousands) Advertising expense, net Advertising expense, net as a percentage of net sales\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023 374,730 3.7%\nFiscal year ended January 29, 2022 387,794 4.5%\n$\n$\nPrepaid advertising costs included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were $9,466 and $7,612 as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022, respectively.\nPre-opening expenses\nNon-capital expenditures incurred prior to the grand opening of a new, remodeled, or relocated store are expensed as incurred.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; shipping and handling costs; retail stores occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses; salon services payroll and benefits; and shrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses includes payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees; advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; stock-based compensation\n61\nJanuary 30, 2021 281,573 4.6%\nTable of Contents\nexpense; depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The amounts reported were derived using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.\nIncome tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 12, “Income taxes”).\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense was $43,044, $47,259, and $27,583 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see Note 16, “Stock-based compensation”).\nInsurance expense\nThe Company has insurance programs with third party insurers for employee health, workers compensation, and general liability, among others, to limit the Company’s liability exposure. The insurance programs are premium based and include retentions, deductibles, and stop loss coverage. Current stop loss coverage per claim is $400 for employee health claims, $100 for general liability claims, and $250 for workers compensation claims. The Company makes collateral and premium payments during the plan year and accrues expenses in the event additional premium is due from the Company based on actual claim results. UB Insurance, Inc., an Arizona-based wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiaries of the Company premiums to insure certain liability exposures. Pursuant to Arizona insurance regulations, UB Insurance, Inc. maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its liability exposures.\nNet income per common share\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share includes dilutive common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method (see Note 17, “Net income per common share”).\n62\nTable of Contents\n3.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced lower than projected revenues and identified indicators of impairment for certain retail stores during fiscal 2020. The Company’s analysis indicated that the carrying values of certain long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets exceeded their respective fair values. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges related to certain retail stores in fiscal 2020. These impairment charges were primarily driven by lower than projected revenues, lower market rate assessments, and the effect of temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also recorded long-lived tangible and right-of-use asset impairment charges related to store closures and suspension of the Canadian expansion during fiscal 2020 as described below.\nStore closures. The Company permanently closed 19 stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2020 reduced the carrying value of the long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets to their fair value.\nSuspension of Canadian expansion. In fiscal 2019, the Company announced plans to expand internationally with an initial launch into Canada. The Company continues to believe international markets provide a long-term growth opportunity. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in September 2020 the Company decided to prioritize growth of its U.S. operations and suspended its planned expansion to Canada. Investments to support the expansion into Canada were limited to early-stage infrastructure buildout and lease obligations for a small number of stores. Impairment, restructuring and other costs related to suspension of the Canada expansion were recognized in fiscal 2020.\nOther severance. As part of the efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company eliminated certain field and corporate roles. As a result, severance expense was recognized during fiscal 2020.\n64\n41,948\n19,569 7,443 489 27,501\n11,016 17,388 717 29,121\n15,752 114,322\nTable of Contents\n5.

Stock-based compensation\nThe Company’s equity incentive plan was adopted in order to attract and retain personnel for positions of substantial authority and to provide additional incentive to employees and directors to promote the success of the business.\nThe Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Award Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, stock payments, deferred stock, and cash-based awards to employees, consultants, and directors. Unless provided otherwise by the administrator of the plan, options vest over four years at the rate of 25% per year from the date of grant and must be exercised within ten years. Options are granted with the exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. As of January 28, 2023, the plan reserves for the issuance upon grant or exercise of awards up to 2,425 shares of common stock.\nThe following table presents information related to stock-based compensation:\n(In thousands) Stock options Restricted stock units Performance-based restricted stock units Total stock-based compensation expense\n$\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023\n7,250 18,483 17,311 43,044\nFiscal year ended January 29, 2022\n$\n$\n11,245 19,286 16,728 47,259\n$\n$\nCash received from stock option exercises Income tax benefit\n$ $\n46,011 3,829\n$ $\n40,386 7,088\n$ $\nStock options\nStock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The estimated grant date fair value of stock options was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the periods indicated:\nVolatility rate Average risk-free interest rate Average expected life (in years) Dividend yield\nJanuary 28, 2023 49.0% 2.4% 3.4 —\nFiscal year ended January 29, 2022 46.9% 0.4% 3.9 —\n71\nJanuary 30, 2021\n10,757 16,608 218 27,583\n12,229 750\nJanuary 30, 2021 43.0% 0.3% 3.4 —\nTable of Contents\nThe expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on Ulta Beauty stock option exercises.

Employee grants generally cliff vest after three years and director grants cliff vest after one year. The grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of shares of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

PBSs granted prior to 2021 cliff vest after three years based upon achievement of pre-established net sales and earnings before tax goals at the end of the second year of the term. The grant date fair value of these PBSs is based on the closing market price of shares of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. PBSs granted in 2021 cliff vest after three years based upon achievement of pre-established net sales and earnings before tax goals for each of the first two years. The performance is then subject to a three year total shareholder return modifier. The grant date fair value of the 2022 and 2021 PBSs are measured using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nPBSs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the probability of achieving the performance goal, with changes in expectations recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the change. If the performance goal is not met, no stock-based compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized stock-based compensation expense is reversed. Forfeitures of PBSs are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of stock award activity and reduce the stock-based compensation expense recognized. At January 28, 2023, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to PBSs was $25,689.

As of January 28, 2023, the maximum number of units that could vest under the provisions of the agreements was 145.\nAwards with market conditions are classified as liability awards and the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Market- based restricted stock units totaling 28 shares were granted to the former Chief Executive Officer in fiscal 2018 and settled during fiscal 2021. Compensation expense for liability awards was $7,671 and $879 in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. There was no compensation expense for liability awards in fiscal 2022.\n17.

Outstanding performance-based restricted stock units are included in the computation of dilutive shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the results would be dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n18. Employee benefit plans\nThe Company provides a 401(k) retirement plan covering all employees who qualify as to age and length of service. The plan is funded through employee contributions and a Company match of 100% of the first 3% of eligible compensation and an additional 50% match for the next 2% of eligible compensation. Total expense recorded under this plan is included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income as follows:\nFiscal year ended\n(In thousands) 401(k) plan match\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023\n21,912\n$\nJanuary 29, 2022\n19,296\n$\nJanuary 30, 2021\n16,878\nThe Company also has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for highly compensated employees whose contributions are limited under qualified defined contribution plans. The plan is funded through employee contributions and a Company match of 100% of the first 3% of salary. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are credited or charged with the performance of investment options offered under the plan as elected by the participants. In the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. The Company manages the risk of changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by electing to match its liability under the plan with\n74\nTable of Contents\ninvestment vehicles that offset a substantial portion of its exposure. Total expense recorded under this plan is included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income and was insignificant during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nAmounts included in the consolidated balance sheets related to the deferred compensation plan were as follows:\n(In thousands) Deferred compensation plan assets Deferred compensation plan liability\n$\nJanuary 28, 2023\n35,382 37,501\n$\n19. Share repurchase program\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2020 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $1,600,000 of the Company’s common stock. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time. During fiscal 2020, the share repurchase program was suspended in order to strengthen liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. The program resumed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2020 Share Repurchase Program.

AMENDED AND RESTATED 2011 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT – Performance Shares\nUlta Beauty, Inc. (the “Company”) pursuant to the Ulta Beauty, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”) hereby grants the following individual the right to earn Restricted Stock Units (each, an “RSU”), subject to the requirements set forth herein and in the Plan. Each RSU earned entitles the Holder to receive an equal number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Shares”) at settlement, as described herein.\nGrant:\nName:\nAddress:\nGrant Date\nTarget Number of RSUs Granted (“Target Award”)\nPerformance Conditions:\nPerformance Period:\n[ ⚫ ]\nEarning of RSUs and Vesting Date:\nThe RSUs are earned (or not) and become “Vesting Eligible RSUs”) based on achievement relative to the Performance Goals and the formulas set forth on Exhibit A to this Award Agreement. To the extent that the Performance Goals are met, then any Vesting Eligible RSUs (and any earned Dividend Equivalents thereon) shall be paid to the Holder on March 15, [ ⚫ ] (the “Vesting Date”), provided the Holder has not incurred a Termination of Service prior to the Vesting Date (except as otherwise provided in Exhibit A).\nUnless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the same meanings set forth in the Plan.\nExhibit 10.20\nDetermination of Earned RSUs. The number of RSUs granted, represents a target number of shares that may be earned based upon satisfaction of the target Performance Goal(s) as set forth on Exhibit A (the “Target Award”). The actual number of RSUs earned (“Vesting Eligible RSUs”) may be greater or less than the Target Award, or even zero and will be determined based on the Company's actual performance level achieved according to the formulas set forth on Exhibit A. All RSUs that do not become Vesting Eligible RSUs shall be forfeited. Once the performance conditions for becoming Vesting Eligible RSUs are satisfied, such Vesting Eligible RSUs remain subject forfeiture until RSUs become “Vested RSUs” on the Vesting Date, unless otherwise provided on Exhibit A.\n1.\nLimits on Transfer. Holder may not sell, pledge, transfer, subject to lien, assign or otherwise hypothecate the RSUs unless and until the RSUs become Vested RSUs, and all other terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan have been satisfied. Any attempt to do so contrary to the provisions of this Award Agreement shall be null and void.\n2.\n3.\nNon-Compete, Non-Solicitation and Confidential Information. The grant of the RSUs is subject to either Holder consenting\nto or having already consented to and abiding by the terms of the Confidential Information & Protective Covenants Agreement (the “CIPCA”).\n4.\nForfeiture.\n(a) violates the CIPCA prior to the Settlement Date, whether or not such RSUs were otherwise Vesting Eligible RSUs.\nUnless otherwise provided in Exhibit A, the RSUs shall be forfeited upon the Holder’s Termination of Service with the Company or if Holder\n(b) Notwithstanding Section 4(a), if the Holder has a Termination of Service by reason of the Holder’s Qualified Retirement prior to March 15, [ ⚫ ], the RSUs will remain outstanding and eligible to vest on March 15, [ ⚫ ] (and shall be settled in accordance with Section 5) as if the Holder has not incurred a Termination of Service; provided, however, that if the Holder owns, operates, or provides any advisory, employment, director or other similar services to any Competitive Business (as defined in the CIPCA) in the Restricted Area (as defined in the CIPCA) at any time during the two (2) years following Holder's Termination of Service, then the unvested RSUs will be immediately forfeited. For purposes of this Agreement “Qualified Retirement” shall mean the Holder’s Termination of Service other than by the Company for Cause at such time that (x) the Holder has reached the age of 55, (y) the sum, rounded up to the nearest whole number, of the Holder’s age (measured to two decimal points) and the number of years (measured to two decimal points) of uninterrupted service with the Company as an Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director, is greater than or equal to seventy (70), and (z) to the extent that the Termination of Service is a result of the Holder’s resignation from the Company, the Holder has provided the Company with at least one (1) year prior written notice of the Holder’s intent to retire (or such other shorter minimum advance written notice that is acceptable to the Administrator in its sole discretion), provided that the Holder continues to provide services during the notice period. The determination of the Administrator as to an individual’s Qualified Retirement shall be conclusive on all parties.\n2\nSettlement and Payment of RSUs. Unless an earlier date is required in Exhibit A, the Company will deliver to Holder the number of Shares equal to the Vested RSUs as on the Vesting Date. The Company shall deliver the Shares electronically into a brokerage account designated by Holder and shall not be required to deliver actual physical Share certificates. The issuance of Shares in settlement of Vested RSUs will be subject to tax withholding, as provided below.\n5.\nWithholding. The Company has the authority to deduct or withhold, or require Holder to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable federal, state, local and foreign withholding taxes with respect to the Shares issued in settlement of Vested RSUs. A Holder may elect to satisfy his or her tax obligation, in whole or in part: (i) with the consent of the Company, by surrendering Shares or having the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under this Award Agreement, in each case with a Fair Market Value on the date of such surrender or withholding equal to the minimum amount of the tax withholding obligation or (ii) by payment in cash or check. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Holder made no such election or the tax obligation arises during a period in which the Holder is prohibited from trading under any policy of the Company or by reason of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then the tax withholding obligation shall automatically be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount of the tax withholding obligation. No Shares will be delivered to Holder in settlement of vested RSUs under Section 5 unless and until all tax withholding obligations have been satisfied.\n6.\nRights as Stockholder. The RSUs awarded under this Award Agreement do not confer upon Holder any rights as a stockholder, including but not limited to any right to vote or receive dividends. To the extent that dividends are paid on Shares, Holder shall be entitled to receive with respect to the RSUs, dividend equivalent amounts equal to the regular cash dividend payable to holders of Shares (to the extent regular cash dividends are paid) as if Holder were an actual shareholder with respect to the number of Shares equal to his or her outstanding RSUs (the “Dividend Equivalents”). Holder’s rights to Dividend Equivalents shall cease upon forfeiture or payment of the RSUs. The aggregate amount of such Dividend Equivalents shall be held by the Company, without interest thereon, and paid to Holder as of the next payroll period after the RSUs are settled as provided in Section 5. Any Dividend Equivalents held by the Company on RSUs which do not become Vested RSUs shall be forfeited and retained by the Company.\n7.\nEmployment. This Award Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment, and does not confer upon Holder the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary. In addition, nothing in the Plan or this Award Agreement shall be interpreted to interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate Holder’s employment or services at any time.\n8.\nNo Additional Rights. Participation in the Plan is voluntary. The value of the RSUs is an extraordinary item that is not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pensions or retirement benefits or similar payments unless specifically and otherwise provided in such plans. Rather, the awarding of the RSUs under the Plan represents a mere investment.\n9.\n3\nLimitations on Plan Rights. The RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan. By acceptance of the RSUs, Holder acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of the RSUs under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other rights in Holder to receive a grant of stock or benefits in lieu of RSUs in the future. Future grants of RSUs, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of the grant, the number of RSUs, and vesting provisions. The Plan has been introduced voluntarily by the Company and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan may be terminated by the Company at any time. By acceptance of the Restricted Stock Unit Award, Holder consents to the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement.\n10.\nClawback. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Award Agreement to the contrary, all RSUs subject this Award Agreement, and any Shares issued upon settlement hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture, or repayment pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Senior Leadership Clawback Policy or any other policy that the Company may implement in compliance with the requirements of applicable law, including without limitation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.\n11.\nSection 409A. To the extent Section 409A of the Code is applicable to the RSUs granted under this Award Agreement, then this Award Agreement and the RSUs granted thereunder are intended to comply with Section 409A and to be interpreted and construed consistent with such intent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Holder is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined under the Company’s established methodology for determining specified employees, then to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation or tax penalties under Section 409A, Shares that would otherwise be issued under this Award (or any other amount due hereunder) upon Termination of Service shall instead be issued on the first business day after the first to occur of (i) the date that is six months following the Holder’s Termination of Service and (ii) the date of the Holder’s death. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “terminate,” “terminated” and “termination” and “Termination of Service” mean a termination of Holder’s employment that constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of the default rules of Section 409A of the Code.\n12.\n13.\nSeverability, Waiver, Modification, Assignment, and Governing Law.\n(a)\nThis Agreement may not be waived or modified except by written agreement of the Company and the Holder, or by court order.\n(b)\nIf either party waives the right to pursue a claim for the other’s breach of any provision of the Agreement, the waiver will not\nextinguish that party’s right to pursue a claim for a subsequent breach.\nIf the forfeiture provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because the definition of Competitive Business or Restricted Area are too broad, or the duration for forfeiture of the RSUs is too long, then the court shall modify such definitions and the duration to the extent necessary in order to\n(c)\n4\nmake Section 4(b) enforceable. If any court determines that the forfeiture provisions in Section 4(b) of this Agreement are unenforceable despite the power to reform them, then Section 4(b) shall be removed from this Agreement in its entirety, and the RSUs will be forfeited, retroactively, as provided in Section 4(a) as of and upon the Holder's Termination of Service and the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not to be affected and should be given full effect.\n(d)\nThis Agreement will inure to the benefit of Company’s successors in interest, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, purchasers, or\nassignees, and may be enforced by any one or more of same, without need of any further authorization or agreement from Holder.\n(e)\nThe laws of the State where Employee is employed by the Company as of the Effective Date of this Agreement will govern this\nAgreement, and the rights of the Parties in any dispute arising from this Agreement.\nAny action relating to or arising from this Agreement must be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or the federal district courts located in the State of Illinois (if sufficient grounds for federal court jurisdiction exist). Employee expressly consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in the aforementioned courts in any such action.\n(f)\nCOMPANY: ULTA BEAUTY, INC., a Delaware corporation By:\nName: Title: Chief Human Resources Officer\n5\nEXHIBIT A PERFORMANCE VESTING\nDefined terms used in this Exhibit A that are not otherwise defined in the Award Agreement or the Plan have the meanings given to such terms in\nthis Exhibit A, including Section 5 below.\n1.

If any court determines that the forfeiture provisions in Section 4(b) of this Agreement are unenforceable despite the power to reform them, then Section 4(b) shall be removed from this Agreement in its entirety, and the RSUs will be forfeited, retroactively, as provided in Section 4(a) as of and upon the Holder's Termination of Service and the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not to be affected and should be given full effect.\n(c)\n4\n(d)\nThis Agreement will inure to the benefit of Company’s successors in interest, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, purchasers, or\nassignees, and may be enforced by any one or more of same, without need of any further authorization or agreement from Holder.\n(e)\nThe laws of the State where Employee is employed by the Company as of the Effective Date of this Agreement will govern this\nAgreement, and the rights of the Parties in any dispute arising from this Agreement.\nAny action relating to or arising from this Agreement must be brought in the courts of the State of Illinois or the federal district courts located in the State of Illinois (if sufficient grounds for federal court jurisdiction exist).

These milestone achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated model, the health of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.”\nKimbell continued, “As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for all our stakeholders.”\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments. Operating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income increased 17.8% to $340.8 million compared to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a $0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nFor the Full Year of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation, increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021. Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower merchandise margin. SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. Operating income increased 26.3% to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to $1.3 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2021. The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021.

These milestone achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated model, the health of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.”\nKimbell continued, “As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for all our stakeholders.”\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments. Operating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

Diluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a $0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nFor the Full Year of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation, increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021. Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower merchandise margin. SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. Operating income increased 26.3% to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to $1.3 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2021.

Net income increased 26.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 33.5% to $24.01, including a $0.07 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $17.98 including a $0.13 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in fiscal 2021.\nBalance Sheet\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $737.9 million.\nMerchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The $104.2 million increase was primarily due to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions, and inventory cost increases.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 722,457 shares of its common stock at a cost of $328.1 million.
