This decrease in gross profit contributes to the overall increase in net income attributable to Amcor plc for FY2023, which is stated to be mainly due to a pre-tax net gain from the disposal of the Russian business, decreased restructuring and impairment costs, and a decrease in income tax expense. Gross margin, which is typically the gross profit divided by net sales, is generally a useful metric for companies to assess the efficiency of their production process and pricing strategy. However, in this case, while the gross margin decreased, the net income increased significantly due to the factors mentioned. Therefore, gross margin might not be the single most useful metric for evaluating the overall financial health of Amcor in FY2023, as other factors such as asset disposal gains and reduction in restructuring costs had a more significant impact on net income.",

In Latin America, net sales declined in the low single digit range driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits.\nAdjusted EBIT of $1,429 million was 1% higher than in the prior period on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting favorable operating cost performance, partly offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 12.8% includes an adverse impact of approximately 100 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $2,777 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis, including a favorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% related to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $25 million (representing 1% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.\n3\nVolume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets, and a mid single digit decline in Latin America. The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as well as customer destocking. In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBIT of $387 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nRigid Packaging\nTwelve Months Ended June 30,\n2022 $ million\n2023 $ million\nReported ∆%\nComparable constant currency ∆%\nNet sales\n3,393\n3,540\n4\n(3)\nAdjusted EBIT\n289\n265\n(8)\n(7)\nAdjusted EBIT / Sales %\n8.5\n7.5\nTwelve months ended June 30, 2023\nNet sales of $3,540 million were 4% higher than last year on a reported basis, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and price increases of approximately $260 million (representing 8% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by approximately 4% lower volumes.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.\nIn Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the region.\nAdjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 4% lower than last year reflecting approximately 6% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 2%.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 8% lower than the same quarter last year as a result of lower consumer demand and customer destocking more than offsetting new business wins. June 2023 quarter hot fill beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.\nAdjusted EBIT of $73 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nNet interest and income tax expense\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period last year, reflecting higher interest rates. GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last year. Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year. Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items in both periods.\n4\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year. The year over year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives. June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.\nNet debt was $6,057 million at June 30, 2023. Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations.\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nFor the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects:\n\nAdjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:\n\nComparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single digit % to up low single digit %, a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, and a negative impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;\n\nA negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of the Company's three plants in Russia on December 23, 2022; and\n\nA benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the balance of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the mid-teens % compared with the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and the residual headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal 2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023, benefiting in-part from structural cost saving initiatives and increased earnings leverage resulting from price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal 2023.\n\nApproximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\nAmcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a degree of uncertainty and additional complexity when estimating future financial results.

You can obtain copies of Amcor’s filings with the SEC for free at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nPresentation of non-GAAP information\nIncluded in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. In arriving at these non- GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include:\n\n• • • • • • • • • •\nmaterial restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans; material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries; changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper; significant pension settlements; impairments in goodwill and equity method investments; material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs; material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory; amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination; gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery; certain regulatory and legal matters; impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nAmcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.\nManagement has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company’s reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort. These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period.\nDividends\nAmcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its ordinary share and CDI registers from September 6, 2023 to September 7, 2023 inclusive.\n7\nU.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ million, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2023\nNet sales\n3,909\n3,673\nCost of

The Company's strong annual cash flow and balance sheet provide substantial capacity to reinvest in the business for organic growth, pursue acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend as well as regular share repurchases.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases in addition to completing three bolt-on acquisitions.\nDividend\nThe Amcor Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12.25 cents per share (compared with 12.0 cents per share in the same quarter last year). Combined with the last three quarterly dividends, this increases the annual dividend for fiscal 2023 to 49.0 cents per share. The quarterly dividend declared today will be paid in US dollars to holders of Amcor’s ordinary shares trading on the NYSE. Holders of CDIs trading on the ASX will receive an unfranked dividend of 18.77 Australian cents per share, which reflects the quarterly dividend of 12.25 cents per share converted at an average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.6526 over the five trading days ended August 14, 2023.\nThe ex-dividend date will be September 6, 2023, the record date will be September 7, 2023, and the payment date will be September 27, 2023.\nShare repurchases\nAmcor repurchased approximately 41 million shares (approximately 3% of total shares issued and outstanding) during fiscal 2023 for a total cost of $431 million.\nAmcor expects to allocate approximately $70 million of cash towards share repurchases in fiscal 2024, as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\n2023 financial results\nSegment Information\nTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2022\nTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2023\nAdjusted non-GAAP results\nNet sales $ million\nEBIT $ million\nEBIT / Sales %\nEBIT / Average funds employed %(1)\nNet sales $ million\nEBIT $ million\nEBIT / Sales %\nEBIT / Average funds employed %(1)\nFlexibles\n11,151\n1,517\n13.6\n11,154\n1,429\n12.8\nRigid Packaging\n3,393\n289\n8.5\n3,540\n265\n7.5\nOther(2)\n—\n(105)\n—\n(86)\nTotal Amcor\n14,544\n1,701\n11.7\n16.3\n14,694\n1,608\n10.9\n15.4\n(1) Return on average funds employed includes shareholders' equity and net debt, calculated using a four quarter average and Last Twelve Months adjusted EBIT.

On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 1% higher than last year reflecting price/mix benefits of 4%, partly offset by approximately 3% lower volumes.\nIn North America, net sales were marginally lower than the prior year driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/ mix benefits. Volumes were higher in the healthcare, pet care, cheese, and home and personal care categories, and this was more than offset by lower volumes in categories including condiments, meat, and ready meals.\nIn Europe, net sales grew in the low single digit range driven by price/mix benefits, partly offset by lower volumes. Volumes were lower in the coffee, home and personal care, yogurt and confectionary categories. This was partly offset by higher volumes in the pet care and pharmaceutical categories.\nNet sales were in line with the prior year across the Asia Pacific region, with price/mix benefits offset by lower volumes. Volumes were lower in China where demand was unfavorably impacted by COVID-19 related lockdowns. Sales growth remained strong in India, Australia, and the pan-Asian healthcare and meat end markets. In Latin America, net sales declined in the low single digit range driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits.\nAdjusted EBIT of $1,429 million was 1% higher than in the prior period on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting favorable operating cost performance, partly offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 12.8% includes an adverse impact of approximately 100 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $2,777 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis, including a favorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% related to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $25 million (representing 1% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.\n3\nVolume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets, and a mid single digit decline in Latin America. The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as well as customer destocking. In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBIT of $387 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nRigid Packaging\nTwelve Months Ended June 30,\n2022 $ million\n2023 $ million\nReported ∆%\nComparable constant currency ∆%\nNet sales\n3,393\n3,540\n4\n(3)\nAdjusted EBIT\n289\n265\n(8)\n(7)\nAdjusted EBIT / Sales %\n8.5\n7.5\nTwelve months ended June 30, 2023\nNet sales of $3,540 million were 4% higher than last year on a reported basis, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and price increases of approximately $260 million (representing 8% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by approximately 4% lower volumes.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.\nIn Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the region.\nAdjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.\nJune 2023 quarter\nNet sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 4% lower than last year reflecting approximately 6% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of approximately 2%.\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 8% lower than the same quarter last year as a result of lower consumer demand and customer destocking more than offsetting new business wins. June 2023 quarter hot fill beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.\nAdjusted EBIT of $73 million was lower than the same quarter last year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost inflation. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.\nNet interest and income tax expense\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period last year, reflecting higher interest rates. GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last year. Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year. Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items in both periods.\n4\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year. The year over year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives. June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.\nNet debt was $6,057 million at June 30, 2023. Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations.\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nFor the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects:\n\nAdjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:\n\nComparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single digit % to up low single digit %, a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, and a negative impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;\n\nA negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of the Company's three plants in Russia on December 23, 2022; and\n\nA benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the balance of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the mid-teens % compared with the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower volumes and the residual headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal 2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023, benefiting in-part from structural cost saving initiatives and increased earnings leverage resulting from price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal 2023.\n\nApproximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously announced in fiscal 2023.\nAmcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a degree of uncertainty and additional complexity when estimating future financial results.

You can obtain copies of Amcor’s filings with the SEC for free at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nPresentation of non-GAAP information\nIncluded in this release are measures of financial performance that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures include adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt. In arriving at these non- GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management, are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance from an improper base. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in our non-GAAP financial performance earnings measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include:\n\n• • • • • • • • • •\nmaterial restructuring programs, including associated costs such as employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations, and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans; material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries; changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper; significant pension settlements; impairments in goodwill and equity method investments; material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs; material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory; amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination; gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery; certain regulatory and legal matters; impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nAmcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations. Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.\nManagement has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company’s reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort. These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period.\nDividends\nAmcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its ordinary share and CDI registers from September 6, 2023 to September 7, 2023 inclusive.\n7\nU.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ million, except per share amounts)\n2022\n2023\nNet sales\n3,909\n3,673\nCost of

        "expected": "Performance is not measured through operating margin",
        "predicted": "The operating margin profile for AMEX as of 2022 is not explicitly stated in the provided passages. To determine if AMEX has an improving operating margin profile, one would typically compare the operating income to the revenue for the years in question to calculate the operating margin and then observe the trend over time.\n\nHowever, from the given information, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **Net Income Trends**: Passage 2 indicates that net income decreased from $8.1 billion in 2021 to $7.5 billion in 2022. This suggests that overall profitability, including factors beyond just operations, has decreased.\n\n2. **Other Expenses**: Passage 1 shows that total other expenses increased from $4,817 million in 2021 to $6,481 million in 2022. This increase in expenses could negatively impact the operating margin if revenues did not increase significantly enough to offset these expenses.\n\n3. **Corporate & Other Pretax Loss**: Passage 5 mentions that the pretax loss for Corporate & Other increased from $1.0 billion in 2021 to $2.2 billion in 2022, driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments and higher compensation costs.\n\n4. **Operating Expenses Growth**: Passage 7 notes that operating expenses increased 24% year-over-year, which could negatively affect the operating margin if revenues did not grow at a comparable rate.\n\nWithout specific data on revenues and operating income, we cannot conclusively state whether AMEX has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022. The information provided suggests that expenses have increased significantly, which would typically imply a decrease in operating margin unless revenues have grown at a faster rate.\n\nOperating margin can be a useful metric for AMEX as it helps to assess the company's efficiency in generating profit from its operations. However, for a financial services company like AMEX, evaluating the profitability and efficiency of its operations can be complex due to various revenue streams (e.g., interchange fees, interest income, service fees) and non-operational factors (e.g., investment gains or losses, credit reserves). Therefore, while operating margin is a useful metric, it should be considered alongside other financial metrics and qualitative factors to get a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance.",

            "Card Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits.

During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made.

American Express's business model is more service-oriented, and its costs are often associated with card member rewards, marketing, salaries, and other operational expenses, rather than the physical production of goods.\n\nInstead of focusing on gross margin, stakeholders might be more interested in metrics such as net revenue growth, provisions for credit losses, expenses related to card member rewards and services, and overall net income, as these more accurately reflect the financial performance and profitability of the company in the context of its business model.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $1,452 primarily driven by increases to cost estimates associated with factory modification labor and support engineering resources due to labor instability and inefficiencies that we now estimate will persist longer than previously anticipated, higher supplier cost estimates based on ongoing supplier negotiations and higher levels of engineering design changes due to technical requirements which are driving increased rework and schedule delays.

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is calculated by adding back interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to the operating income.\n\nHowever, from the provided passages, we don't have direct figures for interest expense and taxes to adjust the operating income. Since we're asked for the unadjusted EBITDA, we'll assume no adjustments for interest and taxes are needed, and we'll only add back D&A (Depreciation and Amortization) to the operating income.\n\nLet's calculate the unadjusted EBITDA and the percentage margin:\n\n1. **Find Operating Income (EBIT)**: This figure is not directly provided, but we can infer it is part of the financial metrics. For this calculation, we would typically look at the income statement, but since it's not provided, we'll assume EBIT is known and refer to it as \"Operating Income\" (OI).\n\n2. **Add Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**: We can find D&A in the cash flow statement. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that are added back to the net income to calculate EBITDA.\n\n3. **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA**: Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A\n\n4. **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin**: Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom Passage 5, we can see the Total Revenues for FY2015 are $1,823,333 thousand. We need the D&A figure to proceed, which should be found in the cash flow or income statement. Unfortunately, the passages do not provide the specific D&A or Operating Income figures needed to complete the calculation.\n\nIf you have the actual Operating Income and D&A figures from the financial statements, you can plug those into the formulas above to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA and the percentage margin.

The 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement enables PepsiCo and its borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $4,200,000,000 in U.S. Dollars and/or Euros, subject to customary terms and conditions, and expires on May 24, 2024. PepsiCo may also, upon the agreement of either the then existing lenders or of additional banks not currently party to the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement to up to $4,950,000,000 in U.S. Dollars and/or Euros. PepsiCo may request renewal of the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement for an additional 364 day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement, PepsiCo and its borrowing subsidiaries may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2023 364 Day Credit Agreement.

We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\nMark-to-market net impact\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nRestructuring and impairment charges\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nA - 6\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\nImpairment and other charges/credits\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\nOther impairment charges\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n2023 guidance\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.

We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\nMark-to-market net impact\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nRestructuring and impairment charges\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nA - 6\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\nImpairment and other charges/credits\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\nOther impairment charges\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n2023 guidance\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 Weeks Ended March 25, 2023 (unaudited)\n12 Weeks Ended 3/25/2023\nImpact of\nImpact of\nNet Revenue Year over Year % Change Frito-Lay North America Quaker Foods North America PepsiCo Beverages North America Latin America Europe Africa, Middle East and South Asia Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region Total (a)\nReported % Change, GAAP Measure\n15 % 9 % 8 % 21 % 5 % 2 % (1) % 10 %\nForeign exchange translation\n— 1 — (6) 5 28 6 2.5\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n— — 3 1 4 — — 2\nOrganic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(b)\n16 % 10 % 12 % 16 % 14 % 29 % 4 % 14 %\nOrganic volume(c) — (5) (3) 1 (9) (2) 2 (2)\nEffective net pricing 16 15 15 15 23 31 2.5 16\n(a) Acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflect the Juice Transaction in PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth shown here differs from the volume change disclosed in the Summary First-Quarter 2023 Performance table on page 2, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE.

These milestone achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated model, the health of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.”\nKimbell continued, “As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for all our stakeholders.”\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments. Operating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income increased 17.8% to $340.8 million compared to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a $0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nFor the Full Year of Fiscal 2022\nNet sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation, increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021. Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower merchandise margin. SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. Operating income increased 26.3% to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to $1.3 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2021. The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021. Net income increased 26.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 33.5% to $24.01, including a $0.07 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $17.98 including a $0.13 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in fiscal 2021.\nBalance Sheet\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $737.9 million.\nMerchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The $104.2 million increase was primarily due to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions, and inventory cost increases.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 722,457 shares of its common stock at a cost of $328.1 million. During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $900.0 million.

Gross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments. Operating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower merchandise margin. SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. Operating income increased 26.3% to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to $1.3 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2021.

The $104.2 million increase was primarily due to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions, and inventory cost increases.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 722,457 shares of its common stock at a cost of $328.1 million.
